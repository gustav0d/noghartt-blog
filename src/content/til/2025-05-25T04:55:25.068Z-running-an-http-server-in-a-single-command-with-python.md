I was running my [Forester](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/ocaml-forester) setup locally, found a specific way to expose an HTTP server easily in Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server <port> -d <directory>
```

This command starts an HTTP server on the specified port and serves files from the specified directory.
