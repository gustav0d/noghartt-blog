Skiplist is a kind of probabilistic data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.
It's basically a linked list with multiple levels of links, where each levels is a subset of the previous level.

It can be used to handle some operations at data level for databases, like handling LSM trees. Check more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list).
