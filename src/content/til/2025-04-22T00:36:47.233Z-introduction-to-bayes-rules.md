The Bayes' rule is a fundamental theorem in probability theory which describes the probability of a given event
based on a prior knowledge of the conditions that might be related to the event.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:
- $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability of event A given event B.
- $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood of event B given event A.
- $P(A)$ is the prior probability of event A.
- $P(B)$ is the marginal probability of event B.
