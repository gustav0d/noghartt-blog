A characteristic of a good engineer is the ability to solve problems. It's not about knowing the answers to every question,
but rather about having the skills to find solutions to the problems that arise. That's what bring value to the real world.
That is something that even goes beyond engineering. It's a skill and a mental model that should be applied in other areas (or even in life in general).

In the end, it doesn't matter if you wrote the algorithm in a specific paradigm, using a specific language with the most elegant patterns.
What will really matter is from your "final customer" and how it solves their problem. It always depends in your customer.

A good mental model is breaking problems into small, deliverable solutions and how much valuation has on its delivering. Even you can be your own
"final customer", for example, when you're writing a script that automates a boring process, which problem do you want to solve? Focusing on the problem
is a good way to start working on a small piece of the puzzle. You can always iterate and compose it, doing small steps, but doing it well.
