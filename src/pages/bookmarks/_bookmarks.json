Jargon-y phrases like “improve your mental search space” or “if at first you don’t succeed, improve your gradient descent”. (I only made up one of these sentences!)\nNormally, I’m all about this kind of metaphorical bridge from one domain to another. But in a lot of these cases, I feel like more direct language would benefit both the discourse on language models and using them to approximate human intelligence.\n\nThe people who make LLMs have little discernible interest in cognition itself. Some of them may believe that they’re interested in cognition, but what they’re really focused on is product — that is, output, what gets spat out in words or images or sounds at the conclusion of an episode of thinking.\n— the irrelevance of thinking – The Homebound Symphony\n\nWhile it’s spectacular that science has found success in modeling human intelligence with matrix multiplication, I think the humans engaged in science would benefit by avoidance of reducing human thought (intelligence, emotion, art, the whole gamut) down to GPU-friendly arithmetic.\n\nA lot of critics think I’m stupid because my sentences are so simple and my method is so direct: they think these are defects. No. The point is to write as much as you know as quickly as possible.\n— Kurt Vonnegut\n",

I went home and spent some time with my family and had a good time getting to have a family holiday meal for the first time in several years. But I also found out the company I’ve been working at is being acquired, and this has me feeling some type of way.\nSo let me tell you a little bit about my first startup experience.\nIt was a liquidity event, just not for me\nSo this was my first time working at a startup. Today is even my 4 year anniversary at the company, and it’s generally been great. I’ve accomplished a lot, I’ve grown a lot as an engineer and as a lead. I’ve gotten to work with very talented engineers and worked on a wide range of things that I had basically never worked on before. My team has been absolutely fantastic and my boss has been the best I’ve had in my career.\nI was in it for the long haul. I specifically said I was interested in more stock options for compensation, because I felt like my role was directly attached to the success of the company. I turned down a red team role at Meta, with a higher tcomp, in order to take this job.\nJoining in 2021 was interesting, because I feel like we were still in the stages where raising money wasn’t crazy difficult. It was the tail end of the ZIRP times. So we were super focused on growth. The team size grew significantly during my first year, it felt like nearly 100% growth.\nThen interest rates started rising, raising funds started getting harder, and the layoffs started occurring across the whole tech industry. During the layoffs in 2023 and 2024, someone on my team was impacted each time, but I survived. But the company was reorienting from growth at all costs towards “how do we become profitable and sustainable” - a business value that I personally resonate with quite a lot. So I was hopeful.\nBut the week before last, we learned of an acquisition. I don’t have the full context on the decisions that led to the sale, but it was clear that we were being ...",

LWN covered\nthe election and results in March. The update commits to improvements\nin communication and candidate selection:\n\nWhat this election exposed was the need for the organization to also\nassess whether candidates were fully eligible to run and prepared to\nbe seated on the board before voting begins. This is something we will\nadd to the election timeline next year. While we have not finished\nfiguring out all of the requirements for that assessment, part of it\nwill be asking candidates to sign a Candidate Agreement at nomination\ntime.

      "description": "Transformers have become a popular tool for learning visual representations, but they can produce artifacts in feature maps that affect their performance. These artifacts are high-norm tokens that appear in low-informative areas of images and are repurposed for internal computations. To address this issue, the authors propose a solution that involves providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer. This solution improves the performance of both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and results in smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing.",

      "description": "This is part of a series on the assault on US science and research. Part XII is here. If only it had been a hurricane, or an earthquake. We know how to deal with those - we know they happen from time to time, and we are willing to spend the time and money to fix things after they do. But what’s happening to the US system of science and R&D is something new, although the damage is just as profound if not worse. I’ve been doing this series of posts for a couple of months now, and I alternate between fits of hope and despair. The despair should be easy to understand: every time you look some new act of vandalism is being perpetrated. Grants revoked, funding cut, agencies shaken up, scientists and administrators fired outright or hounded from office because they just can’t stand it any more. If I tried to keep up with every bit of it I would write about nothing else, and I don’t think I’d be able to stand it much more, either. You can go back over those posts and see what’s been happening as the stories develop. Here I wrote about the oncoming approval of Novavax’s updated Covid-19 vaccine, wondering how the new FDA leadership would handle it. Over the years, such updated vaccines (be they for flu, coronavirus, or what have you) have had easier approval, since the real changes to them are minor. Well, now Mike Makary wants the company to run another clinical trial on it, saying on his social media that “To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies. Under this administration, we are prioritizing the Gold Standard of Science - not what save pharma companies “tens of millions of dollars”. Gold Standard of Science my ass. Watch what happens when RFK, Jr. announces that he has “found” the cause of autism and starts taking action on that, whatever godawful BS it turns out to be. I won’t belabor the point: sane, competent, hardworking scientists h...",

      "description": "Floating point math involves how computers represent decimal numbers, as they can only store integers natively. In a base-10 system like ours, fractions with denominators that are multiples of 10 can be represented accurately, while others like 1/3 or 1/6 result in repeating decimals. This discrepancy leads to situations where 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3 due to how binary systems handle these calculations. Various programming languages showcase these nuances and offer solutions, such as using decimal types or adjusting precision settings to address floating point math discrepancies.",

But it seems both plausible to me\nthat this is what you observe and also I think the method works, so it’s\na useful illustration regardless. that Gendlin and his students wanted\nto figure out what caused some people to improve in therapy and others\nnot, so they looked at transcripts of lots of therapy patients and\nanalysed them for what made the difference. Eventually they realised\nthat the biggest impact was not from anything the therapists did, but\nwhether the patients said “Um” a lot.\nThe explanation for this observation is this: If you’re speaking\neffortlessly and fluently about your experiences, you probably\naren’t paying attention to how you’re feeling, and in particular\nyou’re not checking in with whether what you’re saying actually feels\nlike. If you imagine someone saying “Yup everything is absolutely great,\nI’m doing fine” while their face calls them a liar, that’s the sort of\nthing I’m talking about. Frequently people will do this not because\nthey’re lying, but because they don’t even notice that they’re not\ntelling the truth.\nWhen progress happens, they instead say “Yup everything is absolutely\ngreat, I’m doing fine. Um. Except…” and then start talking about the\nactually important thing.\nGendlin describes the process of realising what you said wasn’t true\nand noticing the feeling you get about it as paying attention to it as\nnoticing the felt sense of the problem. This example comes from\nan exercise he suggests somewhereThis might have been in his book, Focusing, but I think\nI remember this as a suggestion from a friend reporting on Gendlin, so\nit might also be something else. is to say out loud\n“Everything in my life is completely fine.”, notice how that fee...",

Some are just papers I had in my backlog for a bit, or were recently sent to me.\nThe reading listToday's program includes:\n\nDo Llamas Work in English?

      "description": "More ways to work out sums\n\nPublished\n2025-04-26\n\nSorry, still on different ways to calculate the sum of the first n\nintegers. I’ll get bored eventually.\nMy last post Introducing\na parameter to work out sums was originally called “Using generating\nfunctions to work out sums”, but the things I was using in it weren’t\ngenerating functions, and doing it with a generating function ends up\nmuch nicer, in a way that is obvious in retrospect.\nThe generating function of a series \\(a_n\\) is \\(\\sum\\limits_{n \\geq 0} a_n x^n\\). Often you\ncan work out the generating function then take its power series\nexpansion to calculuate jhe original series.\nHere’s how it works:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= \\sum\\limits_{n >= 0} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^n \\\\\n&= \\sum\\limits_{i >= 1} \\sum\\limits_{n \\geq i} i x^n \\\\\n&= \\sum\\limits_{i >= 1} i \\sum\\limits_{n \\geq i} x^n \\\\\n&= \\sum\\limits_{i >= 1} \\frac{i x^i}{1 - x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{1-x} \\sum\\limits_{i >= 1} i x^{i - 1}\\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{1-x} \\frac{d}{dx} \\sum\\limits_{i >= 1} x^i \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{1-x} \\frac{d}{dx} \\sum\\limits_{i >= 0} x^i \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{1-x} \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{(1-x)^3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nRearranging order of sums like this is a fairly standard trick for\nworking out doubly infinite sums. It’s technically justified whenever\nthe sums absolutely converge.\nNow, to get the power series, we just need to work out the kth\nderivative of \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^3}\\).\nThis is \\(\\frac{3 (3 + 1) \\ldots (3 + k -\n1)}{(1 - x)^{3 + k}} = \\frac{(k + 2)!}{(1 - x)^{3+k}}\\).You can prove this with induction if you like. This is a\ngood example of the sort of thing that induction is useful for, where\nyou spot the pattern and just want to go “and so on”. But you can also\njust go “and so on” if you feel like it.\nSo, plugging in \\(x = 0\\) to get the\nderivates at 0 we get\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= \\frac{x}{(1-x)^3} \\\\\n&= x \\sum\\limits_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{(n + 2)!}{2 n!} x^n \\\\\n&= \\sum\\limits_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2}{2} x^{n + 1} \\\\\n&= \\sum\\lim...",

It also introduces the concept of TODO-driven development, where incomplete tasks and bugs are logged and retried automatically.

      "description": "SQLite is often underestimated as a database only suitable for mobile applications and embedded systems. However, by optimizing its configuration, it can achieve high performance on server applications. With the right settings, SQLite can handle thousands of write and read queries per second on a low-cost virtual server. Using SQLite on the backend offers benefits such as reliability, performance, and simplicity. It eliminates network-related failures, has faster read latencies compared to networked databases, and allows scaling on a single machine without the need for complex cluster management. SQLite can also be used with other languages and runtimes and has features like vector search. However, users should be aware of the SQLITE_BUSY error, which occurs when there are conflicting locks on the database. To optimize SQLite for servers, users can configure PRAGMAs, use immediate transactions, and separate write and read connections. Batch writing, sharding, and using STRICT tables can further improve performance. Other considerations include using tools like Litestream for replication and backups, choosing the right filesystem, and planning for zero downtime machine updates. While there are ongoing projects to improve concurrent writes with SQLite, users should be aware of potential pitfalls and limitations. Finally, there are projects exploring distributed SQLite to scale reads and distribute replicas globally.",

      "description": "Hey HN, Anders and Tom here - we’ve been building an end-to-end testing framework powered by visual LLM agents to replace traditional web testing.We know there's a lot of noise about different browser agents. If you've tried any of them, you know they're slow, expensive, and inconsistent. That's why we built an agent specifically for running test cases and optimized it just for that:- Pure vision instead of error prone \"set-of-marks\" system (the colorful boxes you see in browser-use for example)- Use tiny VLM (Moondream) instead of OpenAI/Anthropic computer use for dramatically faster and cheaper execution- Use two agents: one for planning and adapting test cases and one for executing them quickly and consistently.The idea is the planner builds up a general plan which the executor runs. We can save this plan and re-run it with only the executor for quick, cheap, and consistent runs. When something goes wrong, it can kick back out to the planner agent and re-adjust the test.It’s completely open source. Would love to have more people try it out and tell us how we can make it great.Repo: https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43796003\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

In it, I\nstrongly implied that there wasn’t a way to just work out the\nanswer.\nThis isn’t actually true. There’s a quite straightforward way to just\nwork out the answer. It still requires a little bit of spotting the\ntrick, but the tricks in question are more like puzzle pieces that you\nhave to fit together than genuine insights.\nHowever, it requires a bunch more calculus than I wanted to assume in\nmy last post, so I left it out. If you do know the calculus it might be\ninformative though.\nThe idea is this: Rather than work out \\(\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n i\\), we work out\n\\(f_n(x) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n i\nx^i\\), and then evaluate \\(f(1)\\).\nThis will, weirdly, turn out to be easier.\nHow do we do this? Like so:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nf_n(x) & = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^i \\\\\n& = x \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^{i - 1} \\\\\n& = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n x^i \\\\\n& = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{x^{n + 1} - 1}{x - 1} \\\\\n& = x \\left(\\frac{(n + 1)x^n}{x - 1} - \\frac{x^{n + 1} - 1}{(x -\n1)^2} \\right) \\\\\n& = x \\left(\\frac{(n + 1)x^n(x - 1) - x^{n + 1} + 1}{(x - 1)^2}\n\\right) \\\\\n& = x \\left(\\frac{(n + 1)x^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n - x^{n + 1} + 1}{(x\n- 1)^2} \\right) \\\\\n& = x \\left(\\frac{nx^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n + 1}{(x - 1)^2} \\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe want to evaluate \\(f_n(1)\\), but\nthis would require us to divide 0 by 0, so we have to take limits. We\ncan do this with two applications of L’Hôpital’s\nrule.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 1} x \\frac{nx^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n + 1}{(x - 1)^2}\n&=  \\lim_{x \\to 1} x \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{n (n + 1) x^n - (n + 1) n\nx^{n - 1}}{2(x - 1)} \\\\\n& =  \\frac{n (n + 1) n x^{n - 1} - (n + 1) n (n - 1) x^{n - 2}}{2}\n\\\\\n& = \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{n (n + 1)  x^{n - 2} (n x - n + 1)}{2} \\\\\n& = \\frac{n (n + 1)}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhich is the desired result.\nNow, I think it would be reasonable to consider this approa...",

This came out pretty good.\nI suppose I'm guilty of contributing to the glut of AI slop, but while the text and tone are generated, the core idea and sentiment is mine, so it isn’t pure slop.\n\nAlright, let's drop the hand-holding. You — yes, you — the one still whimpering about the parentheses in Lisp. It's time someone told you bluntly: Get over it.\nYour constant refrain about \"too many parentheses\" isn't some profound insight into language design; it's a confession of intellectual laziness. It screams that you encountered something different, something that didn't conform to the aesthetic you were spoon-fed, and you threw up your hands rather than engage your brain.\nAre parentheses really an insurmountable cognitive barrier? Are matching pairs of symbols truly beyond your capacity to track? Let's be honest. The core issue isn't difficulty; it's unfamiliarity coupled with a stubborn refusal to adapt. You've decided what code ought to look like, and anything else is dismissed as \"hard\" or \"ugly\" without genuine effort.\nThousands upon thousands of programmers — people with brains presumably no bigger than yours — have not only managed Lisp's syntax but have thrived with it. They've built complex, powerful systems. They didn't possess some secret anti-parenthesis superpower; they simply possessed the willingness to learn and adapt. They saw the structure, the consistency, the power behind the syntax, instead of getting stuck on the superficial shape of the characters.\nYour complaint isn’t about usability; it’s about preference, and a remarkably shallow one at that. It’s like refusing to read a brilliant novel because you don’t like the font. It demonstrates a lack of curiosity, an unwillingness to look past the surface.\nSo, here's the unvarnished truth: The parentheses aren't the problem. Your rigid thinking is. Your demand that every language cater to your pre-exist...",

I'm Frills. I'm a frontend developer and accessibility specialist. I live in Wales with my fiancé and my dog. I write blog posts that vary between 'should be a toot' and 'random thing you might like' to developer (mostly a11y) tips or how-tos.\nAt university, I studied Digital Media, which covered various digital topics like web design, game and 3D technology and ethics. I already had a foundation of knowledge from being self-taught, so university was a way for me to gather soft skills in teamwork, critical thinking and mentorship. In my second year, I signed up as a Peer Assisted Learning leader, to help the first years in their learning. This is where I found my joy in mentoring and teaching the uninitiated.\nI'm just under a decade on from leaving university with a First degree, with 3 years of being on the Dean's list. I have had a few roles in different types of organisations, from a One Man Band to a higher education institution.\nI spent a few years working in the public sector just around the time that the UK law was changing to include web accessibility in the Equality Act. There was a knowledge gap in my team, and we had plenty of CPD time whilst waiting for red tape approvals so that I could attend webinars and read resources to fill that gap.\nMy interest and knowledge in web accessibility has gone from strength to strength, I value semantic coding and not reinventing the wheel.\nAway from a sc...",

      "description": "I’ve come to the conclusion that my current mental state is fucked up in all sorts of ways for a variety of different reasons. The thing that sucks the most about mental health is that it’s usually not something like a broken leg where you immediately notice something is wrong. Rather, it’s a slow-moving process and you have time to adapt and accept that how you feel is in fact normal and you slowly adapt to your new reality. But my current reality is not normal something has to change.\nThere are many paths to take in order to fix a mind that is not in its best shape and I’m gonna start with one I’m familiar with and that’s meditation. I’ve been interested in meditation for at least 20 years and I’ve practised it on and off for almost as long. But I always looked at it as something I wanted to do while now I see it as something I have to do. And so back on the cushion we go.\nThe good thing is that I have easy ways to track my progress and so I’ll try to share how the journey goes. Because—and this is related to something else I’m gonna write about—the journey is what matters. \nThank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.\nEmail me ::\n                Sign my guestbook :: \n                Support for 1$/month :: \n                See my generous supporters :: \n                Subscribe to People and Blogs",

      "description": "Let's break out a bit of good news. That may sound strange in a post that has \"glioblastoma\" in the title, because as anyone who's looked into it knows, that is not a tumor type associated with any good news at all. The standard treatment is as much surgical removal as is feasible, followed by radiation and treatment with temazolomide. That drug appears to buy a patient about an extra 75 days on this Earth compared to surgery and radiotherapy alone, and that right there folks is the best we have to offer. You can stratify patients by the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter region: that gene expresses the MGMT DNA repair enzyme, which under normal conditions is something you want to have around. But for glioblastoma therapy, that repair process cancels out the brutal DNA-damaging mechanism of temozolomide. So the 40% or so of patients who have the methyl group in this region are in slightly better shape, because they're not expressing the MGMT enzyme very well, while the MGMT-unmethylated-promoter majority are more resistant to temozolomide and have a median survival of about 14 months after diagnosis. It's grim. So this recent paper is very striking. The authors are trying to get immunotherapies to work better in GBM patients, which has been a real challenge. Immune checkpoint therapies (such as anti-PD-1 antibodies) have shown little or no effect, as opposed to several other cancer types, and reasons for that failure probably include a very immunosuppressive environment in the tumor tissue itself along with correspondingly low levels of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). So what do you do about that? That's the question for \"immunologically cold\" tumors in general, and one possible answer is neoadjuvant therapy before attempting surgery. That's where surgical resection is still the primary treatment, but you pretreat with other agents to try to make that surgery more efficacious. The authors of this new paper note that th...",

      "description": "A brief introduction to mathematics with one example many times\n\nPublished\n2025-04-24\n\nThere’s a story repeated so often that it’s a cliche of Gauss’s\nmathematics teacher setting the class the task of adding up the numbers\n1 to 100, supposedly to waste their time and give them a break, only for\nGauss to almost immediately give the correct answer.\nI think it’s a usefully illustrative example to look at for learning\nsome of the basics of mathematics. Partly this is because it illustrates\none of the key uses and methods of mathematics: Getting an answer that\nyou could in theory work out laboriously much faster through logical\ndeducation.\nMostly, though, I’m going to use it to showcase a bunch of different\nways of thinking through a mathematical problem, and use it to teach\nsome common mathematical notation.\nSo, let’s figure out how to do this.\nThe first thing we need to figure out is to how to write it down.\nHere are two obvious ways:\n\n“The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.”\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16\n+ 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 +\n31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 39 + 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45\n+ 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 50 + 51 + 52 + 53 + 54 + 55 + 56 + 57 + 58 + 59 +\n60 + 61 + 62 + 63 + 64 + 65 + 66 + 67 + 68 + 69 + 70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 74\n+ 75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 +\n89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 95 + 96 + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100\n\nNeither of these are actually very good.\nOne of the first lessons of doing mathematics: A lot of mathematics\nis about developing good notation for representing the problem. The\nproblem with the first, plain English, one is that it’s hard to\nmanipulate. We want to be able to do algebra with it, and it’s hard to\ndo algebra with plain English language. Modern mathematics owes a lot to\nRobert\nRecorde for giving us the equals sign (and popularising the plus and\nminus signs), because trying to manipulate sums with plain...",

      "description": "Recently I got a question on formal methods1: how does it help to mathematically model systems when the system requirements are constantly changing? It doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time proving a design works, and then deliver the product and find out it's not at all what the client needs. As the saying goes, the hard part is \"building the right thing\", not \"building the thing right\".\nOne possible response: \"why write tests\"? You shouldn't write tests, especially lots of unit tests ahead of time, if you might just throw them all away when the requirements change.\nThis is a bad response because we all know the difference between writing tests and formal methods: testing is easy and FM is hard. Testing requires low cost for moderate correctness, FM requires high(ish) cost for high correctness. And when requirements are constantly changing, \"high(ish) cost\" isn't affordable and \"high correctness\" isn't worthwhile, because a kinda-okay solution that solves a customer's problem is infinitely better than a solid solution that doesn't.\nBut eventually you get something that solves the problem, and what then?\nMost of us don't work for Google, we can't axe features and products on a whim. If the client is happy with your solution, you are expected to support it. It should work when your customers run into new edge cases, or migrate all their computers to the next OS version, or expand into a market with shoddy internet. It should work when 10x as many customers are using 10x as many features. It should work when you add new features that come into conflict. \nAnd just as importantly, it should never stop solving their problem. Canonical example: your feature involves processing requested tasks synchronously. At scale, this doesn't work, so to improve latency you make it asynchronous. Now it's eventually consistent, but your customers were depending on it being always consistent. Now it no longer does what they need, and has stopped solving their problems.\nEvery succ...",

      "description": "This article is best viewed on desktop.In 2006, IEEE Spectrum ranked patenting powerhouses in our first annual patent survey. The survey, conducted by the research firm 1790 Analytics, examined the number and influence of U.S. patents generated by more than 1,000 organizations. Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology came out on top at the time, with IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Broadcom rounding out the top five.Nearly 20 years later, every company on the top 10 list has been usurped. Once mighty companies have fallen in the ranks, others have come and gone, and the top spots are largely filled by today’s Big Tech companies. In place of semiconductors and computer systems, the top categories in this year’s scorecard are all about Internet services—the category labeled “Telecom and Internet”—and consumer electronics.Digging into the data reveals Amazon’s might, the hidden power of subsidiaries, and which countries are producing U.S. patents—it’s not just the United States. You can explore it all for yourself in the interactive graphic below. Simply click on a category to see which companies produced the most powerful patent portfolios in 2024.The rankings are based on Pipeline Power, a metric calculated by 1790 Analytics that combines several elements of an organization’s patent portfolio into one number. In addition to the number of patents granted in a given year, this metric takes into account four variables representing the quality and impact of those patents. (More details on the calculations are below in the Methodology section.)Amazon Tops the ListAt a glance, it’s clear that Amazon leads with the highest patent power. The tech giant has produced a more influential patent portfolio than entire industry categories.However, Amazon didn’t produce the largest number of patents in 2024. That achievement goes to Samsung; with more than 9,000 patents, the electronics company was granted more than twice the number produced by the second most prolific comp...",

Nix-ld serves as a shim layer, allowing users to specify necessary libraries for each executable without modifying them, enhancing the usability of third-party binaries and proprietary software on NixOS. By configuring nix-ld with common libraries, users can run pre-compiled executables more smoothly, addressing issues encountered with running binaries on NixOS.",

      "description": "What is probabilistic programming?\n\nPublished\n2025-04-23\n\nFriends and family often ask me what probabilistic programming is.\nThis isn’t very surprising, as I currently work in probabilistic\nprogramming. Unfortunately I haven’t had a very good answer for\nthem, as this is quite a recent development for me and I haven’t fully\nunderstood the boundaries of the field.\nI think also it’s hard to answer because the field is a little\nconfused about what it is, and there’s a “What the field says it is”\nanswer and “What the field actually is” answer.\nSo I’m going to try to give my own answer of what I think the field\nis. It will be a bit overbroad and claim some territory that could\nequally be put in other fields, but I think the overbroad definition is\nmore informative than the overly narrow one.\nFirst, let me give you a narrow answer that I think people would\nclassically give:And the\nwikipedia page gives. Probabilistic programming is the\nfield of developing probabilistic programming languages.\nWhat’s a probabilistic programming language? Well it’s a particular\ntype of tool for doing the thing I’m about to describe in the general\nanswer.\nSo, this is what I think: Probabilistic programming is the field of\nconstructing random samplers with precise distributional properties,\ncentrally but not exclusivelyThat is, this is the origin of the field and the major\ndriver of progress in it, but the techniques are more broadly useful and\nusing them to do other things would still be considered probabilistic\nprogramming. with the goal of\ndeveloping better Monte Carlo methods for doing statistics.\nI will now unpack all of those terms so that this definition actually\nmakes sense.\nA random sampler is a program that, when run, generates some\nvalue, typically at random. You could imagine e.g. a coin flip, which\nrandomly generates either “heads” or “tails” as your prototypical random\nsampler. The work I did in Hypothesis is also an example of a random\nsampler, where it generates test cases for...",

      "description": "This article is crossposted from IEEE Spectrum’s careers newsletter. Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free!One of the most common mistakes I’ve observed among job seekers is over-sharing. When you’re interviewing at a company, remember this key insight: Don’t share information that hurts you.This frequently comes up for folks who have been affected by a “performance-based” layoff. Your explanation for how and why you left your last job can have a huge impact on your interviews. I have two tactical pieces of advice:First, reframe the layoff as a mutual decision instead of something that happened to you. No one wants to hire a victim.❌ “I was unfairly punished by a horrible company”✅ “My career goals didn’t align with the company at the time”Second, focus the conversation more on where you’re headed rather than what you’re leaving behind. Here’s a sample answer: “I’m super excited about this company. I deeply resonate with the mission and smaller environment.” (You should, of course, adapt this to match what you care about and the role you’re applying for.)You will likely be asked, “Why did you leave your last job?” but you have the power to decide what to share. You shouldn’t lie, but you also need not be fully transparent.Many people will experience a layoff or reduction in force at least once in their career. Instead of blaming yourself or the company, your framing should be: “There was a mismatch in expectation between employee and employer.” There are countless reasons why an engineer may have poor performance: lack of support, poor management, lack of motivation, or shifting company needs. Have the humility to learn from your mistakes, but remember to advocate for yourself, too.Have the confidence that you are valuable. Too many engineers are their own worst critics, which exacerbates a negative spiral of performance.The te...",

      "description": "Accidents happen, but not all of them are inevitable. Drunk driving is one of the deadliest and most preventable causes of roadway fatalities. In 2022 alone, more than 13,000 people died in alcohol-related vehicular crashes in the United States, accounting for nearly a third of all traffic deaths, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Now a group of high school students in North Carolina is taking action with SoberRide, an AI-enabled device they designed to prevent intoxicated people from driving.Breathalyzer-based ignition interlocks are already in use; they require the driver to blow into a device, proving they are sober enough to drive. However, these interlocks are not foolproof because someone other than the driver could breathe into them, trying to outsmart the device.SoberRide uses a combination of cameras, sensors, and machine-learning algorithms to detect signs of alcohol impairment in the driver—such as pupil dilation, bloodshot eyes, and the presence of ethanol used in alcoholic beverages—before allowing a vehicle to be put into drive. “We’ve been training our neural network to classify intoxication, refining the system’s ability to reliably sense whether someone is drunk or sober,” says Swayam Shah, chief executive officer and cofounder of SoberRide. He’s an 11th-grader at Enloe Magnet High School, in Raleigh.The SoberRide team presented its invention at the MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference in October, sponsored by groups like the IEEE University Partnership Program and IEEE Women in Engineering.The students also showcased their technology at another IEEE-supported event: the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Communication, held in December in Xiamen, China. From tragedy to technology  The inspiration for SoberRide came from a tragedy. Shah was in eighth grade when a neighbor was killed in a collision caused by a drunk driver. The loss prompted Shah to research the magnitude of...",

I learned that titles largely\nreflect the limits we place on ourselves.\nPromotionTrying to figure out what you must do to get promoted seems\nkind of insane to me, or at least reinforces our sense of our own\nlimits. Instead, at every stage in your career, you focus on doing the\nintersection of:\n\nwhat you see needs to be done\nwhat you are capable of doing\nwhat you have the desire/energy (or would find fulfillment) doing\n\nAnd you're going to get promoted. That's it.\nBurn your title. Burn your job description. I mean, keep your boss\nhappy for sure. Keep your teammates happy by supporting them and\nbuilding them up and communicating well. But don't ask to be made a\nlead, just do whatever you see needs to be done.\nAnd if after doing this, demonstrating this level of agency, you are\nnot promoted, it just means you're not at a good company or good\norganization within your company and you should look elsewhere.\nWhat's more this work you did at a company that doesn't appreciate\nyour agency, if that happens to be the case, merely makes the stronger\ncase for your successful interview at the next company.

      "description": "This is an interesting and unexpected article on a possible treatment route towards metastatic tumors (or tumors that are likely to metastatize). The authors are working in the field of \"tumor-initiating cells\" (TICs), a term that may remind you of the \"cancer stem cells\" that went through an intense period of research some years back. That work was in the end disappointing, but the idea that there are privileged populations of tumor cells, at least for some tumor types, that are more immune-resistant (and more chemotherapy-resistant as well?) is still plausible. Since this time, tumor-initiating cells have been described in several different tumor types, with features notably biased toward creating and sustaining very local microenvironments at the beginning of carcinogenesis. And there have been sustained efforts to distinguish them from the earlier stem cells as well. The new report linked above looks like a very direct way to test the worth of this idea, because the authors report that streptomycin (!) is capable of selectively killing TICs. That is of course an antibiotic from the Classical era (1943!) that is still used today as part of a cocktail therapy for tuberculosis as well as several other bacterial infections. The team had previously found that the penicillin/streptomycin combination could stop TICs from forming spherical assemblies as they grew in suspension culture, and this paper is the result of further work chasing down the mechanism behind that effect. (Suspension culture, as opposed to monolayers, seems to favor activity of TICs). It turns out that streptomycin itself is the active principle, and as a single agent it kills TICs through an oxidative-stress mechanisms that does not seem to occur in normal cell populations. Other aminoglycoside antibiotics did not show this effect at all. SAR work showed that the aldehyde group on the antibiotic is key to its actions here, which means that this is probably distinct from the antibiotic mechanism ...",

If you’ve\ngot some transition matrix \\(P_{ij}\\),\na reversible distribution for it is a probability distribution \\(q\\) over the states such that \\(q_i P_{ij} = q_j P_{ji}\\).\nIt’s a theorem that every reversible distribution is stationary. That\nis, if \\(q\\) is reversible then \\(q_i = \\sum\\limits_j P_{ji} q_j\\) for all\n\\(i\\) - the distribution is not changed\nby running the Markov chain forwards.\nThe proof of this presented in the text I was reading is as\nfollows:\nWe can write \\(q_i = q_i \\sum\\limits_j\nP_{ij}\\) (because it’s a standard property of transition matrices\nthat this sum is 1), so \\(q_i = \\sum\\limits_j\nq_i P_{ij} = \\sum\\limits_j q_j P_{ji}\\), so \\(q\\) is stationary.\nI can follow this proof of course. It’s very simple algebra. But\nthere’s something about it that feels like a magic trick. I don’t feel\nlike I’ve got any actual insight into the nature of reversible\ndistributions or have any sense of why they must be stationary from\nthis. I’m sure there are plenty of mathematicians who could, and I’m not\neven sure that I need that insight, but it bugged me.\nThinking about it a bit more lead me to come up with the following\nalternative proofWhich I suspect I have cribbed in some sort of\nhalf-remembered manner from Geoffrey Grimmett’s “Probability on Graphs”,\nbut if so it was useful to recreate it from memory anyway.\nOne way to think about distributions on markov chains is that you’ve\ngot a certain amount of “stuff” (probability mass) floating around, and\nat each step that you run the Markov chain, this probability mass flows\naround the graph.\nWhen you’ve got a probability distribution \\(q\\), all of \\(q_i\\) flows out of node \\(i\\), and \\(\\sum\\limits_j q_j P_{ji}\\) flows into it.\nThat is, for each node \\(j\\), the mass\nin it flo...",

      "description": "Connect 4 is a solved game in the m,n,k family. On a 7 column, 6 row board, players alternately drop a token into a column, attempting to establish four tokens of the same color along any row, column, or diagonal. John Tromp created a labeled dataset of all valid eight ply positions with their perfect play win results. We present a dataset that presents all sequences of plies that lead to each position along with their associated win result class.\nDownload Link\ncsv.gz (~8m) sha1sum: 1e683b7af9496f171ad7f1bed67491708f7de55b\nBackground\nConnect Four is a two-player, perfect knowledge game invented by Howard Wexler and sold by the Milton Bradley firm starting in 1974. As of 2025, the game is sold by Hasbro. The game has been solved both weakly (James D. Allen and Victor Allis, independently, in 1988) and strongly (John Tromp in 1995). Tromp donated his dataset of “all legal 8-ply positions in the game of connect-4 in which neither player has won yet, and in which the next move is not forced.”\nA given board position may have multiple sequences of plies (individual moves) that result in that configuration. For example, the board:\n6       o       \n5       x       \n4       o       \n3       x       \n2     o o       \n1     x x       \n  a b c d e f g\nmay be created with any of the four sequences:\nx:c1 o:c2 x:d1 o:d2 x:d3 o:d4 x:d5 o:d6 \nx:d1 o:d2 x:c1 o:c2 x:d3 o:d4 x:d5 o:d6 \nx:d1 o:d2 x:d3 o:d4 x:c1 o:c2 x:d5 o:d6 \nx:d1 o:d2 x:d3 o:d4 x:d5 o:d6 x:c1 o:c2 \nThe constraint is that, since pieces fall to the lowest row, a piece underneath another piece must have been dropped earlier in the sequence. Thus, c1 must be before any c2, but c1 may be before or after d1. Within this dataset, x always indicates the first player and o the second player.\nAs another example, this board configuration features an o move that is not dependent on an x move:\n6       o       \n5       x       \n4       o       \n3       x       \n2       o       \n1   x   x   o   \n  a b c d e f g\nWithin the list of...",

      "description": "#“Conteúdo”, uma commodity cognitiva que se \"consome\"\npor MARCELO SOARES\nEsta edição expande ideias que alinhavei originalmente em fios do Bluesky.\nPor três décadas, o nome do escritor Neil Gaiman, gravado em qualquer coisa, foi sinônimo de qualidade e vendas. Seu talento para a escrita, afiado produzindo quadrinhos cheios de referências mitológicas e obscuras, inspirou incontáveis edições especiais, coleções de bonecos e obras audiovisuais, além de incontáveis tatuagens e inícios e finais de relacionamentos entre seus fãs espalhados ao redor do mundo.    \nEm 2024, isso mudou. Acusações de abuso sexual contra Gaiman abalaram a imagem “cool” do autor. As situações mais repugnantes foram relatadas em reportagem de capa da revista “New York”. Aos fãs, restava uma questão: o que fazer com tudo o que se pensou e criou a partir da obra dele?\nSituação complicada: é fácil se desinteressar por qualquer coisa nova que um autor vier a escrever, como sabe quem evitava ler opiniões de um grande escritor como Vargas-Llosa, recentemente morto. Mas é impossível desler o que foi lido e dispensar o que foi pensado, especialmente se tinha qualidades, se estimulou ideias, conversas, criações.   \nNas redes sociais, onde as opiniões mais simplistas são as mais engajantes, há sempre pessoas com opiniões veementes sobre tudo, especialmente sobre a vida e hábitos alheios: “é muita vontade de consumir conteúdo de gente escrota”, escreveu alguém.\nE aí, nesse juízo peremptório sobre o caráter de alguém desconhecido cujo pecado é ler, talvez haja uma chave para entender o ambiente atual de circulação de informação, cultura e ideias.    \nApesar de continuarem existindo diferenças importantes entre os tipos de produção cultural, e o que é feito para ler vai saindo de moda, tudo hoje virou “conteúdo”.    \nE o que é esse tal de “conteúdo”?\nÉ uma commodity cognitiva, em grande parte indiferenciada, por mais que tenha diferenças de formato, que economicamente vale mais pela quantidade do que pela ...",

      "description": "The study examines how the politeness of prompts affects large language models (LLMs), noting that politeness levels impact human communication effectiveness. LLMs seem to reflect human cultural norms, and the study evaluates politeness effects on LLMs in English, Chinese, and Japanese tasks. Findings indicate impolite prompts lead to lower LLM performance, and excessive politeness doesn't always improve outcomes, with optimal politeness varying by language. This highlights the importance of considering politeness in cross-cultural natural language processing and LLM utilization.",

      "description": "\nI've recently been playing Blue Prince, which is a great time if you are a fan of puzzle games like Return of the Obra Dinn or Outer Wilds and also a fan of roguelike games like Slay the Spire.\nOne of the game's rooms, the Parlor, features a logic puzzle that is different on each run. In this post we'll be doing some modelling and analysis of these puzzles. Some people might consider that a spoiler!\nIn the parlor, there are three boxes, a blue box, a white box, and a black box. Each box makes some set of statements. We are also given the following rules:\n\nThere will always be at least one box that makes only true statements.\nThere will always be at least one box that makes only false statements.\nThere is a prize in exactly one box.\n\n\nHere's one example of such a puzzle:\nBlue: You are in the parlor\nWhite: This box is empty\nBlack: The blue box is true\n\nThe blue box is making an obviously true statement—the box game always takes place in the Parlor. The black box thus is also making a true statement, since blue is true. Since we know by the rules that there must be at least one box making false statements, it can only be white, and so we can deduce that white is not empty and has the prize.\nThe puzzles get a bit trickier than this sometimes. Consider:\nBlue: the gems are in a box with a true statement\nWhite: the gems are in a box with a false statement\nBlack: The white box is true\n\nThere are actually two consistent interpretations here: both\nBlue: true\nWhite: false\nBlack: false\n\nand\nBlue: false\nWhite: true\nBlack: true\n\nare valid. The trick is that the game is not to determine which boxes are telling the truth, but where the prize is, and in this case, either interpretation gives that the prize is in the blue box.\nLet's make a tool that solves these puzzles automatically! This might be useful, if, say, you were making this game and writing a lot of them and wanted some kind of mechanical assurance as part of a test suite that you hadn't made a mistake. \nWe can repres...",

Pay special attention to this part of the MCP specification: For trust & safety and security, there SHOULD always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations. Applications SHOULD: • Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model • Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked • Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the loop I suggest treating those SHOULDs as if they were MUSTs. I really want this stuff to work safely and securely, but the lack of progress over the past two and a half years doesn’t fill me with confidence that we’ll figure this out any time soon.

      "description": "\nIn 1991, very few people had Internet access. Those who did post in online forums or email friends from home typically accessed the Internet via telephone line, their messages traveling at a top speed of 14.4 kilobits per second. Meanwhile, cable TV was rocketing in popularity. By 1991, sixty percent of U.S. households subscribed to a cable service; cable rollouts in the rest of the world were also picking up speed.Hypothetically, using that growing cable network instead of phone lines for Internet access would dramatically boost the speed of communications. And making cable TV itself digital instead of analog would allow cable providers to carry many more channels. The theory of how to do that—using analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processing to translate the analog waveforms that travel on coaxial cable into digital form—was well established. But the cable modems required to implement such a digital broadband network were not on the mass market.Enter Henry Samueli. In 1985, he had established a multidisciplinary research program at the University of California, Los Angeles, to develop chips for digital broadband. Over the next several years, he and his team created a wide variety of proof-of-concept chips demonstrating the key building blocks of high-performance digital modems. And in 1991, Samueli, along with his UCLA grad student Henry Nicholas, founded Broadcom Corp. to commercialize the technology.Today, the innovations in digital signal processing architectures pioneered at UCLA and Broadcom persist in the digital modems that enable both wired and wireless communications in our devices. For these advances, along with contributions to expanding science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, Samueli is the recipient of the 2025 IEEE Medal of Honor.Henry Samueli \nCurrent jobs: Philanthropist, Chairman of Broadcom Inc.\n\nDate of birth: 20 September 1954\n\nBirthplace: Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nFamily: Wife, Susan; three children; three grandchi...",

      "description": "Alex and Teddy here. We’re launching Magic Patterns (https://www.magicpatterns.com), an AI prototyping tool that helps PMs and designers create functional, interactive designs and websites. There’s a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK8C_tQBwIU, as well as video walkthroughs of specific examples at https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/tutorials/v...While other tools help with “AI-assisted coding,” we have been quietly focused on “AI-assisted designing.” With Magic Patterns you can visually communicate your idea, get hands on feedback from customers, and test new features.Teddy and I are best friends and former frontend engineers turned founders. We arrived at Magic Patterns after several pivots—always in the design tooling space, but different products that all struggled to get usage. We started working on Magic Patterns after an internal hackathon. Teddy built a UI library catalog and I messed around with GPT 3.5. We thought it’d be fun to combine the two: an AI component generator. Describe whatever you want, and get back a React component!That started to take off and we gained users, but it wasn’t developers using the tool. Instead, it was PMs, designers, and leadership who could finally communicate their ideas. They use it to test new ideas quickly, get feedback from customers, and improve communication with internal teams. Also, hobbyists (and programmers who aren’t designers) use us to create designs and UIs that they wouldn’t be able to otherwise.We use Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, and leverage a fine-tuned model for fast-applying edits. The most challenging part is determining the most relevant context to feed to the LLM. We attempt to solve this with our click to update feature and by letting users define a brand preset, or default prompt.Unlike other tools in this space, we’re specifically focused on (1) product teams—we're realtime and collaborative; and (2) frontend only—we don't spin up a database or backend because we aren't solving ...",

We discuss actionable tools for breaking out of the addictive cycle and staying free of obsessions and compulsions. We also examine the relationship between trauma and addiction.\n\nWe explore the full recovery process—from detoxing and physical stabilization to building distress tolerance. We review evidence-supported tools to structure your life at each stage of recovery and highlight the power of learning “self-directed state shifting” through yoga nidra (NSDR), breathwork, meditation and prayer.\n\nWe explain how to recognize signs of addiction in yourself and others, and the treatment options available across all levels of resources, from residential programs to 12-step. If you or someone you know is struggling with any kind of addiction, this episode offers practical steps to break free and stay free.\n\nRead the episode show notes at hubermanlab.com.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levelshealth.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ryan Soave\n00:01:32 Addiction, Addictive Behaviors, Relief\n00:06:10 Rehab, Detox, Physical & Emotional Stability\n00:13:33 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Levels\n00:16:08 Recognizing Addition; Video Games, Parents & Responsibility\n00:23:38 Experiencing Real Life vs Addictive Behavior; Dopamine Dynamics\n00:29:38 Drugs & Feelings; Reordering Your Life; Roles, Kids vs Parents\n00:40:03 Sponsors: AG1 & LMNT\n00:43:13 Tool: 30 Days Abstinence & Addiction; Impact\n00:46:10 Creating a Life Post-Addiction, Jellinek Curve\n00:55:30 Tool: Emotional Weather Forecast, Gratitude, Plan, Strivings\n01:02:48 Connection with Others, Mental Willpower Throughout Day, Defining Best Self\n01:08:3...",

This concept was illustrated by C. Northcote Parkinson using the example of a committee spending time on trivial issues like a bicycle shed instead of the design of a nuclear power plant. The law has been applied to software development and decision-making processes, highlighting the tendency for individuals to spend disproportionate time on small decisions and less time on significant ones. This phenomenon is supported by research showing that people often struggle to determine the amount of information needed to make decisions effectively, leading to inefficiencies in the decision-making process.",

Fascism is on the rise worldwide and in the United States\nthe news is particularly alarming. The time has arrived to act.\nThe enemy wants you to be overwhelmed and depressed, to feel like the situation\nis out of your control. Propaganda is as effective on me as it is on you, and in\nmy own home the despair and helplessness the enemy aims to engineer in us often\nprevails in my own life. We mustn’t fall for this gambit.\nWhen it comes to resistance, I don’t have all of the answers, and I cannot\npresent a holistic strategy for effective resistance.  Nevertheless, I have put\nsome thought towards how someone in my position, or in my community, can\neffectively apply ourselves towards resistance.\nThe fact of the matter is that the tech sector is extraordinarily important in\nenabling and facilitating the destructive tide of contemporary fascism’s ascent\nto power. The United States is embracing a technocratic fascism at the hands of\nElon Musk and his techno-fetishist “Department of Government Efficiency”. Using\nmemes to mobilize the terminally online neo-right, and “digitizing” and\n“modernizing” government institutions with the dazzling miracles of modern\ntechnology, the strategy puts tech, in its mythologized form – prophesied,\neven, through the medium of science fiction – at the center of a revolution of\nauthoritarian hate.\nAnd still, this glitz and razzle dazzle act obscures the more profound and\ndangerous applications of tech hegemony to fascism.

It\nwould not be alone for long. By the time the first Pole Vault stations were\ncomplete, work was already underway on a similar network for Alaska: the\nWhite Alice Communication System, WACS.\nAlaska has long posed a challenge for communications. In the 1960s, Western\nUnion wanted to extent their telegraph network from the United States into\nEurope. Although the technology would be demonstrated shortly after, undersea\ntelegraph cables were still notional and it seemed that a route that minimized\nthe ocean crossing would be preferable---of course, that route maximized the\nlength on land, stretching through present-day Alaska and Siberia on each side\nof the Bering Strait. This task proved more formidable than Western Union had\nimagined, and the first transatlantic telegraph cable (on a much further south\ncrossing) was completed before the arctic segments of the overland route. The\n\"Western Union Telegraph Expedition\" abandoned its work, leaving a telegraph\nline well into British Columbia that would serve as one of the principle\ncommunications assets in the region for decades after.\nThis ill-fated telegraph line failed to link San Francisco to Moscow, but its\naftermath included a much larger impact on Russian interests in North America:\nthe purchase of Alaska in 1867. Shortly after, the US military began its\nexpansion into the new frontier. The Army Signal Corps, mostly to fulfill its\nfunction in observing the weather, built and staffed small installations that\nstretched further and further west. Later, in the 1890s, a gold rush brought a\nsudden influx of American settlers to Alaska's rugged terrain. The sudden\neconomic importance of Klondike, and the rather colorful personalities of the\nprospectors looking to exploit it, created a much larger need for military\npresence. Fortuitously, many of the forts present had been ...",

But within minutes, he and local NGO partners were able to set up a full-featured digital classroom using nothing more than a solar panel and a yellow device the size of a soup can.Students equipped with only basic smartphones and old tablets were accessing content through Beekee, a Swiss-built lightweight standalone microserver that can turn any location into an offline first, pop-up digital classroom.While international initiatives like Giga try to connect every school to the Internet, the timeline and cost remain hard to predict. And even then, according to Unesco’s Global Education Monitoring Report, keeping schools in low-income countries online could run up to a billion dollars a day.Beekee, founded by Vincent Widmer and Sergio Estupiñán during their PhD studies at the educational technology department of the University of Geneva, seeks to bridge the connectivity gap through its easy-to-deploy device.At the core of Beekee’s box is a Raspberry Pi-based microserver, enclosed in a ventilated 3D-printed, thermoresistant, plastic shell. Optimized for passive and active cooling, weather resilience, and field repairs, it can withstand heat in arid climates like that of Jordan and northern Kenya.With its devices often deployed in remote regions, where repair options are few, Beekee supplies 3D print-friendly STL and G-code files to partners, enabling them to fabricate replacement parts on a 3D printer. “We’ve seen them use recycled plastic filament in Kenya and Lebanon to print replacement parts within days,” says Estupiñán.The device consumes less than 10 watts of power, making it easy to run for over 12 hours on an inexpensive 20,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) power bank. Alternately, Beekee can run on compact solar panels, where batte...",

I think we may see very large advances in the power of\nthese systems over the\nnext few years.\n\n\n\n\nI'd previously thought that the main impact of AI on the NAO was\nthrough accelerating potential adversaries, and so shorter timelines\nprimarily meant more urgency: we needed to get a comprehensive\ndetection system in place quickly.\n\n\n\n\nI now think, however, that this also means the best response involves\nsome reprioritization.  Specifically, AI will likely speed up some\naspects of the creation of a detection system more than others, and so\nto the extent that we expect rapid advances in AI we should prioritize\nthe work that we expect to bottleneck our future AI-accelerated work.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to plan for this is to imagine what would be the main\nbottlenecks if we had a far larger staff. Imagine if each senior\nperson had AI support equivalent to all the smart junior people they\ncould effectively manage.  Or even (but my argument doesn't depend on\nthis) AI systems that are as capable as today's experienced\nresearchers.

Foundations like Apache have set high standards by being selective about projects they host, especially discouraging those that drift into monetization models that reduce openness — such as paywalling core components or shifting key features behind paid licenses.\nA current .NET Foundation project, Avalonia, appears to be heading in this direction with its recent move to introduce a paid toolkit called “Accelerate.” - related thread.\nWhile some argue this is a necessary evolution for financial sustainability, it’s worth noting that many high-impact FOSS projects — Linux, Debian, Python, PHP, and Laravel to name a few — have managed to thrive with models that build businesses around the software, rather than limiting freedom within it.\nIf the .NET Foundation seeks to deepen trust within the wider OSS and POSIX communities, it should reflect on whether hosting open-core projects aligns with its long-term vision. A constructive dialogue with Avalonia’s maintainers could lead to a model that supports sustainability without compromising on openness — something many in the .NET open source community deeply value.\nOpen .NET has a bright future, and it’s crucial that decisions today help preserve both the technical and ethical integrity of the ecosystem.\nIt might be time for the .NET Foundation to initiate a conversation with the Avalonia team and consider offering guidance on sustainable, community-aligned models. Open Source .NET carries high hopes for the future — and allowing short-term monetization decisions to dilute core freedoms risks killing the proverbial hen that lays the golden eggs.",

It's been said that musl is slow(er than glibc), which is true, to a point.musl uses SWAR on a size_t to implement various functions in string.h. This is fine, except size_t is just 32-bit on Wasm.I found that implementing a few of those functions with Wasm SIMD128 can make them go around 4x faster.Other functions don't even use SWAR; redoing those can make them 16x faster.Smooth sort also has trouble pulling its own weight; a Shell sort seems both simpler and faster, while similarly avoiding recursion, allocations and the addressable stack.I found that using SIMD intrinsics (rather than SWAR) makes it easier to avoid UB, but the code would definitely benefit from more eyeballs.See this for some benchmarks on both x86-64 and Aarch64: https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/actions/runs/145169318...\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43730458\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

Most words mean\nthe same thing, and those that don't are usually concrete enough not\nto cause confusion (ex: lift, flat, chips).  The tricky ones, though,\nare the ones that differ primarily in connotations.  For example:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn American English (AE), \"quite\" is an intensifier, while in\nBritish English (BE) it's a mild deintensifier.  So \"quite good\" is\n\"very good\" in AE but \"somewhat good\" in BE.  I think \"rather\" works\nsimilarly, though it's less common in AE and I don't have a great\nsense for it.\n\n\n\"Scheme\" has connotations of deviousness in AE, but is neutral\nin BE.  Describing a plans or system as a \"scheme\" is common in BE and\nnegative in AE.\n\n\n\"Graft\" implies corruption in AE but hard work in BE.\n\n\n\n\nThese can cause silent misunderstandings where two people have very\ndifferent ideas about the other's view:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: \"I can't believe how much graft there was in the procurement\nprocess!\"\n\n\nB: \"Yes, quite impressive.  Rather keen on going above and beyond,\naren't they?\"\n\n\nA: \"And did you see the pension scheme they set up?\"\n\n\nB: \"Sounds like they'll be quite well off when they'll leave\noffice.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn this example A leaves thinking B approves of the corruption, while\nB doesn't realize there was any.  It could be a long time, if ever,\nbefore they realize they misunderstood each other.\n\n\n\n\nAre there other words people have run into that differ like this?\n\n",

You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the RSS feed.\nIf you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on Ko-Fi.\n\nLet's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?\nMy name is Jeremy Keith. I’m from Ireland. Cork, like. Now I live in Brighton on the south coast of England.\nI play traditional Irish music on the mandolin. I also play bouzouki in the indie rock band Salter Cane.\nI also make websites. I made a community website all about traditional Irish music that’s been going for decades. It’s called The Session.\nBack in 2005 I co-founded a design agency called Clearleft. It’s still going strong twenty years later (I mean, as strong as any agency can be going in these volatile times).\nOh, and I’ve written some nerdy books about making websites. The one I’m most proud of is called Resilient Web Design.\nWhat's the story behind your blog?\nI was living in Freiburg in southern Germany in the 1990s. That’s when I started making websites. My first ever website was for a band I was playing in at the time. My second ever website was for someone else’s band. Then I figured I should have my own website.\nI didn’t want the domain name to be in German but I also didn’t want it to be in English. So I got adactio.com.\nTo begin with, it wasn’t a blog. It was more of a portfolio-type professional site. Although if you look at it now, it looks anything other than professional. Would ya look at that—the frameset still works!\nAnyway, after moving to Brighton at the beginning of the 21st century, I decided I wanted to have one of those blogs that all the cool kids had.

      "description": "The MIT CADR Lisp Machine had a number of static RAMs that were\n  used in the processor for various things such as state machines and\n  register files.  The core parts of the LMI Lambda Lisp Machine were\n  similar to the CADR (similar enough that they could run the same\n  microcode) but technology had advanced such that the static RAM\n  chips were typically double the size of the CADR's.  The LMI Lambda\n  thus had twice as many registers as the CADR, but because there\n  weren't any extra bits in the instruction set, you couldn't address\n  half of them.  The extra address bit from the RAM was wired to a\n  status register.  So the LMA Lambda had, in effect, two banks of\n  registers which you could swap between by toggling the bit in the\n  status register.  This was not normally used — the microcode would\n  set the bit to zero and leave it there.\nA friend of mine was interested in security and he had written a\n  high performance version of the encryption algorithm used by Unix to\n  encrypt passwords.  He was experimenting with dictionary attacks\n  against passwords and one bottleneck was the performance of the\n  password encryption algorithm.\nIt occurred to me that I could store the DES S-boxes in the\n  alternate register bank of the LMI Lambda.  With some special\n  microcode, I could turn an LMI Lambda into a DES machine that could\n  churn through a dictionary attack at a high speed.  I added a\n  special Lisp primitive that would swap the register banks and then\n  run several hundred rounds of the DES algorithm before swapping back\n  and returning to Lisp.  Then I wrote a Lisp program that would feed\n  a dictionary into the DES primitives when the processor was\n  idle.\nI was able to discover a few passwords this way, but I was more\n  interested in the proof of concept that the actual results.  A\n  microcoded DES machine would work, but you'd get better performance\n  out of dedicated hardware.",

      "description": "Decomposing Aurora DSQL\nRiffing, I guess.\nEarlier today, Alex Miller wrote an excellent blog post titled Decomposing Transaction Systems. It’s one of the best things I’ve read about transactions this year, maybe the best. You should read it now.\nIn the post, Alex breaks transactions down like this:\n\nEvery transactional system does four things:\n\nIt executes transactions.\nIt orders transactions.\nIt validates transactions.\nIt persists transactions.\n\n\nthen describes how these steps map to traditional OCC and PCC systems, research designs like Calvin, and real-world systems like FoundationDB.\nHow do these steps map to Aurora DSQL?\nAn overview of DSQL’s architecture may be useful if you haven’t been following along so far:\nNow, an hour of video and 20 minutes of reading another post later, we’re back. Let’s dive in.\n\nExecuting a transaction means evaluating the body of the transaction to produce the intended reads and writes.\n\nAurora DSQL executes transactions on a horizontally scalable fleet of Firecracker-isolated, PostgreSQL-powered, query processors. At this stage there’s no coordination at all. MVCC is used for reads during execution, and no writes escape the query processor running that particular transaction. See this post for more on this step.\n\nOrdering a transaction means assigning the transaction some notion of a time at which it occurred.\nValidating a transaction means enforcing concurrency control, or more rarely, domain-specific semantics.\n\nIn DSQL, ordering and validating happen in parallel, done by the adjudicators involved in the transaction. Each adjudicator provides a range of possible orderings (not after, not before), and one final adjudicator makes the final ordering decision. Similarly, each involved adjudicator weighs in on validation, with one final adjudicator checking that everybody says yes. Strictly, the final-final order is chosen only after validation completes, but the ordering and validation protocols run in parallel. See this post for ...",

This both makes me very\nunwilling to get out of bed, but also means that I actually need the\nextra sleep or I’ll be kinda useless all day.\nWhy do I wake up feeling like shit in the morning?\nWell, one reason is that my sleep onset time isn’t consistent. If I\nwake up at 7AM (which I usually do right now because of the dawn\nchorus), I’ll be fine if I got to sleep before midnight and feel\nexhausted if I got to sleep around 2AM.\nSo, in order to wake up in the morning, I need to make my bed time\nconsistent.rofl\nObviously I’m not going to do that. I could try, but it’s the sort of\nhabit change where it’s too easy to disrupt,For example it might get to late and I might realise\nI’ve not written a notebook post today… and\nthen disruptions compound.

Instead, I wanted to hear the actual debate from the actual thread!So I asked Claude 3.7 to build this for me as a browser-only app. It just needs a thread URL and an Elevenlabs API key (this all remains in your browser, you can check the source code, it's only 3 files, there is no server storage of anything).To make the resulting audio experience as natural as possible, each commenter has a different voice.Commenters who appear multiple times in the thread have the same voice, and introduce themselves. A bit of context is also introduced when coming back \"up\" from deeply nested comments.You can play the resulting audio or download it for later listening. I'm planning to later add the ability to load multiple threads so I can have a playlist generated for listening in the gym!Any comments or improvement suggestions are appreciated!\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43720767\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

This is a role I've been gravitating towards throughout my career and has been something I've done unofficially several times, so it's been very enjoyable working on it as part of my \"day job\".\nFor the last ~12 months I've been in the DevFlow team, where we own internal + external tooling that targets \"left of the main branch\" to make teams more productive within Elastic's Platform organisation - think automated builds + CI, supply chain security, dependency management, development environments, test tooling, code quality and security, and many more things!\nIn that time, I've learned a few lessons about building software for developers, especially when those developers are in your organisation, and thought they'd be worth sharing.\nGet out of the way of the user, as soon as you can\nAlthough we'd love to craft ✨ beautiful, seamless experiences that are a joy to work with and brighten everyone's days 🌈 that's (unfortunately) not often the case.\nWhile we (as Engineering Productivity, Developer Experience, Platform teams, or insert-job-function-here) are often building tooling, services or platforms that we are proud of, and that for the most part have the best intentions in mind, we're also going to be the cause of frustration for engineers.\nWe need to remember that each unfixed bug or piece of friction can lead to an engineer that's already having a bad day have an even worse day. This can compound with the tools we're building possibly being on the \"critical path\" (and therefore mandated), meaning that folks likely can't introduce workarounds to avoid dealing with our tools.\nWith that in mind, we should be trying to make sure that our tools actively avoid causing strife and seeing how we can \"get out of the way\" as soon as possible - focus on how to provide a well-scoped set of functionality that can be used.\nFor instance, this could be a case of prov...",

State-of-the-art clock synchronization focuses on improving accuracy or frequency of synchronization, ignoring the properties of the local clock: lost of connectivity to the remote clock means synchronization failure.\nOur system, Graham, leverages the fact that the local clock still keeps time even when connectivity is lost and builds a failure model using the characteristics of the local clock and the desired synchronization accuracy. Graham characterizes the local clock using commodity sensors present in nearly every server and leverages this data to further improve clock accuracy, increasing the tolerance of Graham to failures. Graham reduces the clock drift of a commodity server by up to 2000×, reducing the maximum assumed drift in most situations from 200ppm to 100ppb.\nComments",

      "description": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by Amazon.The cutting edge of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) doesn’t occur just at NASA, or one of the top university labs, but instead is increasingly being developed in the warehouses of the e-commerce company Amazon. As online shopping continues to grow, companies like Amazon are pushing the boundaries of these technologies to meet consumer expectations.Warehouses, the backbone of the global supply chain, are undergoing a transformation driven by technological innovation. Amazon, at the forefront of this revolution, is leveraging robotics and AI to shape the warehouses of the future. Far from being just a logistics organization, Amazon is positioning itself as a leader in technological innovation, making it a prime destination for engineers and scientists seeking to shape the future of automation.Amazon: A Leader in Technological InnovationAmazon’s success in e-commerce is built on a foundation of continuous technological innovation. Its fulfillment centers are increasingly becoming hubs of cutting-edge technology where robotics and AI play a pivotal role. Heath Ruder, Director of Product Management at Amazon, explains how Amazon’s approach to integrating robotics with advanced material handling equipment is shaping the future of its warehouses.“We’re integrating several large-scale products into our next-generation fulfillment center in Shreveport, Louisiana,” says Ruder. “It’s our first opportunity to get our robotics systems combined under one roof and understand the end-to-end mechanics of how a building can run with incorporated autonomation.” Ruder is referring to the facility’s deployment of its Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), called Sequoia, as well as robotic arms like “Robin” and “Cardinal” and Amazon’s proprietary autonomous mobile robot, “Proteus”.Amazon has already deployed “Robin”, a robotic arm that sorts packages for outbound shipping by transferring packages from conveyors t...",

I explain conditioning protocols designed to enhance four types of endurance, from long-duration steady state to muscular endurance and high-intensity intervals, and how each training style triggers unique adaptations in the body and brain, such as improved mitochondrial function and oxygen utilization. Additionally, I highlight the crucial role of hydration and electrolytes, which are essential for neural function and influence the brain’s willpower to sustain effort.\n\nRead the episode show notes at hubermanlab.com.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\nFollow Huberman Lab\n\n\nInstagram\n\nThreads\n\nX\n\nFacebook\n\nTikTok\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Huberman Lab Essentials; Build Endurance\n00:00:50 Energy Sources, ATP, Oxygen\n00:04:14 Neurons & Willpower, Glucose & Electrolytes\n00:09:19 Heart, Lungs; Physiology & Performance Limiting Factors\n00:10:35 Sponsor: AG1\n00:12:30 Muscular Endurance, Protocol, Concentric Movements, Mitochondria\n00:19:10 Sponsors: LMNT & Eight Sleep\n00:22:00 Long-Duration Endurance, Efficiency, Mitochondria, Capillaries\n00:25:54 High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Anaerobic Endurance, Protocol\n00:32:33 High-Intensity Aerobic Endurance, Adaptations\n00:35:30 Sponsor: Function\n00:37:26 Brain & Body Adaptations, Heart\n00:40:40 Hydration, Tool: Galpin Equation\n00:42:21 Supplements, Stimulants, Magnesium Malate\n00:43:11 Recap & Key Takeaways\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

Harry\nFrankfurt is a very respectable philosopher who writes really\ninteresting things about motivation and desire and how we live our\nlives. He also wrote”On Bullshit”, which while genuinely excellent, ends\nup being his Cherry Pie, and is the main thing people think of when he\ncomes up. I mentioned this book to a friend and her immediate response\nwas “Is that the bullshit guy?”. I imagine him grimacing every time\nsomething like this happens, but I find it very funny.\nIt’s… one of those books that I don’t know whether or how to\nrecommend, because I got a huge amount out of reading it, but I don’t\nknow how much of that was actually in the book and how much of it was in\nthe context which I was reading it in. It’s short, well written, and\nabout as engaging as a moderately dry work of analytic philosophy can\nbe. I also cried multiple times while reading it.But this is part of the context, and I’m easily brought\nto tears at the moment. Don’t worry about it, I’m fine. Well, I’m not\nfine, but things are trending in an upwards direction and the people who\nneed to know why I am sad do. So,\nI guess I recommend it, and if you don’t like it then oh well it’s very\nshort.\nOne of the things it discusses is what it means to care about some\noutcome, and how this contrasts with desiring it. He says you can desire\nsome outcome without particularly caring about it. e.g. When bored, you\nmight watch a movie to alleviate that. You desire to watch the movie to\nalleviate the boredom but that doesn’t mean you particularly care about\nthe movie. You can care about your work, but be so burned out that you\ncan’t manage any desire to do good work.\nFrankfurt suggests that caring consists, in part, of wanting or\nthinking that it is important to desire the end. When you care about\nsomething, and also desire it, that desire fee...",

      "description": "Short one this time because I have a lot going on this week.\nIn computation complexity, NP is the class of all decision problems (yes/no) where a potential proof (or \"witness\") for \"yes\" can be verified in polynomial time. For example, \"does this set of numbers have a subset that sums to zero\" is in NP. If the answer is \"yes\", you can prove it by presenting a set of numbers. We would then verify the witness by 1) checking that all the numbers are present in the set (~linear time) and 2) adding up all the numbers (also linear). \nNP-complete is the class of \"hardest possible\" NP problems. Subset sum is NP-complete. NP-hard is the set all problems at least as hard as NP-complete. Notably, NP-hard is not a subset of NP, as it contains problems that are harder than NP-complete. A natural question to ask is \"like what?\" And the canonical example of \"NP-harder\" is the halting problem (HALT): does program P halt on input C? As the argument goes, it's undecidable, so obviously not in NP.\nI think this is a bad example for two reasons:\n\nAll NP requires is that witnesses for \"yes\" can be verified in polynomial time. It does not require anything for the \"no\" case! And even though HP is undecidable, there is a decidable way to verify a \"yes\": let the witness be \"it halts in N steps\", then run the program for that many steps and see if it halted by then. To prove HALT is not in NP, you have to show that this verification process grows faster than polynomially. It does (as busy beaver is uncomputable), but this all makes the example needlessly confusing.1\n\"What's bigger than a dog? THE MOON\"\n\nReally (2) bothers me a lot more than (1) because it's just so inelegant. It suggests that NP-complete is the upper bound of \"solvable\" problems, and after that you're in full-on undecidability. I'd rather show intuitive problems that are harder than NP but not that much harder. \nBut in looking for a \"slightly harder\" problem, I ran into an, ah, problem. It seems like the next-hardest class...",

Originally, we built[0] it as a pool of warm Docker containers running Chromium, exposing:- Chrome DevTools Protocol (for Playwright/Puppeteer)- noVNC (for live view)We’ve been following the unikernel space for a while, so we decided to see if we could get our image on one. We went with Unikraft Cloud[1]. Here’s how it did:- Boot-up time: 10–20ms (vs. ~5s for Docker containers)- Near 0 CPU/memory consumption when idle- Still ~8GB RAM when active (headful Chromium)Potential use cases:- Standby mode during long-running jobs: unikernels can sleep after X sec of inactivity, reducing clock time costs- Session reuse: auth/session cookies persist for hours/days. Basically as long as the cookies are valid- Cold start speed: good for low-latency, event-based handlingWe open sourced it with Apache 2.0! Feel free to fork or submit an issue / PR.

Most people with rooftop or small commercial solar have never heard of them, let alone claimed them, but they’re real! They are typically bought by utilities or companies to meet climate targets.The problem is, the process to claim and sell RECs is a mess—designed decades ago for utility-scale players, not individuals or small businesses.To register a system and start claiming RECs, you usually have to: Navigate one of 10+ regional REC registries, each with its own documentation, forms, and rules; Pull generation data from your inverter or utility, format it, and submit it manually; Try to find a buyer (often through a broker or opaque exchange) and negotiate payment.That takes weeks if not months for a single system, and most people give up. As a result, millions of solar installations leave income on the table every year. We started Jasmine Energy after seeing this firsthand: some of us worked in energy startups, and others watched our parents install solar but never claim a single REC.Jasmine automates all of this. Our platform: Extracts metadata from your solar documents using AI and auto-registers your system in the correct registry; Connects to your inverter to submit generation data and verify REC eligibility; Lists RECs for sale through partners, tracks the sale process, and issues payouts—all through a single dashboard.This domain is a good fit for automation and LLMs—not to generate text, but to (1) structure unstructured documents, (2) interact with legacy government websites where there’s no API, and (3) deal with repetitive bureaucratic language.To be clear, we’re not tryin...",

Ao vivo, introduzi algumas modificações, que não incluí no texto. Achei interessante compartilhar na newsletter, que andava um pouco abandonada.\n\nNos últimos dez anos, vivemos sob a sombra da pós-verdade. Desde 20 de janeiro deste ano, entramos de cabeça na era da pós-vergonha.\nCom as redes sociais sendo o principal meio de informação utilizado especialmente pelos mais jovens e pelos mais velhos, os marcadores tradicionais de credibilidade da informação, de veracidade mesmo, foram gradualmente implodidos. \n“As universidades”, assim de baciada, são tratadas como antros de safadeza, censura e extremismo, enquanto os extremistas mesmo vendem cursos de ficar rico (eles ficam) ou tentam empurrar uma história paralela do Brasil. \n“A imprensa”, assim de baciada, foi tomada como inimiga do povo, enquanto extremistas primeiro criaram sites de notícias falsas e depois bombaram canais onde pessoas carismáticas falam absurdos em vídeo monetizado. \n“As ONGs”, assim de baciada, foram carimbadas como poços de dinheiro financiados por interesses globalistas, enquanto extremistas criaram suas próprias organizações, muitas vezes ligadas a igrejas fundamentalistas. \nNinguém se beneficiou mais disso do que parte da direita, financiada pela turma do petróleo por meio de fundações e imbuída dos ideais expostos no livro “The Sovereign Citizen” (O Cidadão Soberano), publicado nos anos 90 pelo pai de um político britânico que ficou a cargo de implementar o Brexit. \nNesse livro, ele expõe opiniões que soariam apenas exóticas nos anos 90: governo só serve para roubar; com a internet, quem tem meios poderá fugir do imposto e criar seus próprios Estados, suas próprias moedas e seus próprios fatos privados. Dizem que esse livro antecipou o que viriam a ser as criptomoedas. Essas ideias exóticas seduziram Peter Thiel, grande financiador do extremismo digital que se criou no apartheid...",

If you're curious about our upcoming event, check https://codebebeameurope.com ✨\n\nUnit tests are a fundamental defence line to prevent subtle bugs from sneaking into our code base. The problem is that writing them can sometimes feel like a tedious, repetitive and error-prone chore.\n\nThat's when snapshot testing comes into play. It makes an alluring promise: completely rid the developer of the boring task of having to manually write and manage unit tests' assertions! While it may sound too good to be true, there's no magic trick and we'll discover the ins and outs of snapshot testing in Gleam: what it is, how it works and, most importantly, how to use it effectively.\n\nLet's keep in touch!

      "description": "Kristoffer Grönlund\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/78/\nIncreasingly, programming languages come with their own built-in package managers. In early scripting langugages like Perl and Python, these systems were ad-hoc and mainly focused on making it easy for developers to find modules to use on sites like CPAN and PyPI. More recent languages come with complete toolchains for managing the development and distribution of both libraries and applications.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Linux distributions have been centered around package management for a long time. Most if not all distributions have their own package management system, designed to make it possible for the distribution developers to package, maintain and curate libraries and applications, delivering software updates and security patches and ensuring that the overall system is consistent and works well.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on the intersection of these two package management philosophies. I have been involved in the process of making software written in the rust programming language available through the openSUSE package management system, and will describe the challenges we have faced and the challenges that still remain for Linux distributions as developers get more and more used to working with language-specific package management systems.",

      "description": "A new study estimates that CT scans could lead to about 103,000 future cancers each year, which is around 5% of all cancers diagnosed. While the risks are small, experts agree that doctors should use CT scans carefully and consider alternative imaging methods when possible. Overall, the benefits of diagnosing serious conditions often outweigh the slight increase in cancer risk from these scans.",

You see, I spent most of my weekend away from the computer, which included not setting aside the time to write this that I normally would. I can’t say it was entirely intentional, at least not at first. But by the end of Sunday, it was definitely a conscious choice I was making, to not jump on the computer. To not feel the pressure I put on myself with great frequency to be “productive.”\nInstead, I spent the weekend relaxing. I binge watched both seasons of SAS Rogue Heroes, which I enjoyed quite thoroughly. It was a nice mix of “feels like history” and entertainment. I haven’t historically enjoyed watching many things that take place around World War 2, but I feel like this one was great. It’s from the makers of Peaky Blinders, which I also haven’t watched, but that I might watch now that I watched and enjoyed this.\nWhen I wasn’t relaxing watching this show, I took time to go outside and enjoy the weather. I went out for multiple walks, both weighted and not, and got about 10 miles in between Friday and Sunday.\nI feel like this was an important thing to do, because for the last several weeks I have been working practically non-stop, in order to finish some projects I set out to do. I am heading home to see my family next week, and I wanted to get as much done as I could before I leave for that. And so I spent probably 60 hours a week for the last month working on things. I would not recommend it, but I will say that I always feel a remarkable sense of accomplishment when I’m able to buckle down like that and really get things done.\nSpeaking of that, I’m a day late on this post and I will unfortunately be skipping the retro slated for April 20th, since I won’t have any of my personal computers with me, and I keep a hard boundary between work and personal devices, so won’t be writing this post on my work laptop.\nI also found myself, earlier in the week, thinking about my personal values.

A study warns that the rising number of scans and increased radiation doses may result in 5% of all cancers in the country. While CT scans are important for diagnosis, they should only be used when clinically justified to minimize risks.",

      "description": "The new generation of code assistance tools powered by Large Language Models (LLM)s may be useful in efficiently categorizing and translating historical software corpora. In this qualitative study, we examine LLM performance in explaining and translating FLOW-MATIC programs. We also test their reliability by injecting OCR-like errors into the text.  Released in 1958, FLOW-MATIC targeted business applications and used a heavily English-inspired syntax that later influenced COBOL. We find that the models perform inconsistently for describing the key aspects of a program but fare better when translating business logic into SQL. LLMs appear robust against OCR-like errors in the source code, but we caution against relying on the current technology.\n\nFLOW-MATIC Brochure\n\n\nMotivation\nHistorical source code may contain insights into the development of algorithms,  programming practices, and shed light into the computational needs and pursuits of organizations. However, this same source code is often poorly cataloged, unavailable in digital form (e.g. exists in the form of paper tape or punch cards), and will usually be written in archaic programming languages, thus frustrating efforts to understand and interpret it. In order for researchers to effectively “triage” piles of artifacts and obtain a limited understanding of the contents, researchers might use an LLM to help explain and translate the code.\nWhy FLOW-MATIC?\nDeveloped by Dr. Grace Hopper and her team at Reminton Rand from around 1955 to 1958, FLOW-MATIC was an early language targeted at business applications. Internally, the language was called B-0 and experimented with an English-like syntax. Using approximately 33 verbs and coupled with an external data description language, programmers could implement sequential data processing logic (Sammet 1969).\nWe chose FLOW-MATIC for this study because:\n\nThe language is sufficiently obscure that there is unlikely to be any special-case logic for the language, and\nThe man...",

      "description": "Charles Dodgson (pen name Lewis Carroll) had difficulty remembering numbers, such as dates. He developed a cipher to help him remember numbers by embedding them in couplets or phrases. For example, the couplet “Brass trumpet and brazen bassoon, will speedily mark you a tune” encodes the specific gravity of brass (8.39) in the last four consonants: r k t n (y is treated as a vowel). In this article, we describe the cipher, present online tools for encoding and decoding, discuss how we implemented the algorithms in TypeScript, and the cipher’s relevancy to steganography.\nMemoria Technica\nThe cipher encodes plaintext’s of sequences of digits. Using the cipher, consonants (except ‘y’) are mapped to digits. Vowels, punctuation, and ‘y’ are ignored and thus can be freely added to the ciphertext The mapping follows the figure:\n\n\nMapping of consonants and digits\n\n\nIn a three-page pamphlet published by Carroll in 1878, he describes how the digits and their associated letters came to be:\n\n\"b\" and \"c\", the first two consonants in the Alphabet.\n\"d\" from \"duo\"; \"w\" from \"two\".\n\"t\" from \"tres\"; the other may wait awhile.\n\"f\" from four; \"q\" from \"quatuor\".\n\"l\" and \"v\", because \"L\" and \"V\" are the Roman symbols for \"fifty\" and \"five\".\n\"s\" and \"x\", from \"six\".\n\"p\" and \"m\", from \"septem\".\n\"h\" from \"huit\"; and \"k\" from the Greek \"okto\".\n\"n\" from \"nine\"; and \"g\" because it is so like \"9\".\n\"z\" and \"r\", from \"zero\".\n\nThe letter “j” is associated with 3 because it is left-over.\nDecoding ciphertext involves extracting the consonants from a message and finding the mapped integer. Vowels, y, and punctuation are ignored.\nEncoding an integer involves choosing one of two consonants for each digit and inserting vowels, y, and punctuation to create valid words.\nDecoding may also involve “meta” information. In the pamphlet, Carroll provides example couplets for encoding the specific gravities of various metals. The decoder will need to know that only the last four consonants are relevant.\nExamp...",

I teach them asymptotics with a rigour that’s impeccable, I’ll show them how to make their proofs mechanically checkable. On parsing algorithms I can hold it with the best of them, With LL(1) and CYK and Earley and the rest of them. I’ll teach them all the levels of the Chomsky hierarchy… With a nod towards that Natural Language Processing malarkey. I’ll summarize the history of the concept of a function, And I’ll tell them why their Haskell code is ‘really an adjunction’. In matters mathematical and logical, etcetera, I am the very model of an Informatics lecturer.  For matters of foundations I’m a genuine fanaticker: I know by heart the axioms of Principia Mathematica, I’m quite au fait with Carnap and with Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, And I’ll dazzle you with Curry, Church and Turing combinators. I’ll present a proof by Gödel with an algebraic seasoning, I’ll instantly detect a step of non-constructive reasoning. I’ll tell if you’re a formalist or logicist or Platonist… For I’ll classify your topos by the kinds of objects that exist. I’ll scale the heights of cardinals from Mahlo to extendible, I’ll find your favourite ordinals and stick them in an n-tuple. In matters philosophical, conceptual, etcetera, I am the very essence of an Informatics lecturer.  And right now I’m getting started on my personal computer, I’ve discovered how to get it talking to the Wifi router. In Internet and World Wide Web I’ve sometimes had my finger dipped, And once I wrote a line of code in HTML/Javascript. [Sigh.] I know I have a way to go to catch up with my students, But I try to face each lecture with a dash of common prudence. When it comes to modern tech: if there’s a way to get it wrong, I do!

The nomination I just received may be the best.As a new student at the uni, Philip Wadler was the first introductory lecture I had, and his clear passion for the subject made me feel excited to begin my journey in computer science. In particular he emphasised the importance of asking questions, which made the idea of tutorials and lectures a lot less intimidating, and went on to give really valuable advice for starting university. I enjoyed this session so much, and so was looking forward to the guest lectures he was going to do for Inf1A at the end of semester 1. They certainly did not disappoint, the content he covered was engaging, interesting, and above all very entertaining to listen to, especially when he dressed up as a superhero to cement his point. Because I found these talks so rewarding, I also attended the STMU that he spoke at about AI and ChatGPT, and everyone I talked to after the event said they had a really good time whilst also having a completely new insightful perspective on the topic. In summary, Philip Wadler has delivered the best lectures I have attended since starting university, and I have gotten a lot out of them.Thank you, anonymous first-year student! ",

Typing is not the\nbottleneck, because “typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming\ntime”. Programming is thinking, talking to people, planning,\nresearching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your\nkeyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.\nI get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.\nBut here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull\nrequest descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,\ndocumentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,\nrequirements.\nAnd being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets\nme get back to the thinking.\nEffort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can\ntype 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you effort to type something\nand, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.\nTake me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.\nIt’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every\nthird word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need\nto correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my\nphone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.\nIf you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an\nangry growl-like sound.\nWhich is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I\nhave, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often\nrefrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, bec...",

We spend large parts of our days writing down\ninstructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we\nchose the right instructions.

Sometimes it’s a separate room, sometimes the downstairs apartment.\nThey help the local Mittelstand companies with their contracts,\nor they’re specialised in traffic law and can help you when you had a car crash.\nThey know possibly everyone in the notary’s office on a first-name basis, use\ntheir telephone as the primary means of communication and their suits aren’t\ntailor-made. There’s a fax number on the business card, since this is Germany.\nIf you leave this town, drive for 45 minutes and then take a plane for another\n45 minutes and 7 hours you end up in New York City, where they also have\nlawyers. Let me dip my broad brush into some cheap paint I got from movies and\nTV shows and paint you one of these New York lawyers from one of New York’s big\nlaw firms: big office in a skyscraper, expensive suit, expensive apartment,\nlarge corporations as clients, lots of money being paid every hour, hundreds of\ncolleagues that worry about all the things a lawyer shouldn’t need to worry\nabout so they can concentrate on high-level decisions.\nI’m fully aware that these paintings are not masterpieces.

They take an input, usually a string, and produce a number, ensuring that the same input always returns the same number within a specified range. Good hash functions aim to minimize collisions, where different inputs result in the same output. Evaluating hash functions includes looking at the avalanche effect, which measures how input changes impact output. Understanding hash functions is crucial for implementing data structures like hash maps, which store key-value pairs efficiently using hash functions to determine storage locations. Good hash functions lead to even distribution, reducing the need for extensive searching within the data structure.",

Tuning a bloom filter involves balancing the number of hash functions and bits based on the desired false-positive rate and the number of items to store, with considerations for accuracy and memory efficiency.",

      "description": "\nThis post was originally published on the V8 blog.\n\nThe ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification (ECMA-402, or Intl) provides key locale-specific functionality such as date formatting, number formatting, plural form selection, and collation. The Chrome V8 and Google Internationalization teams have been collaborating on adding features to V8’s ECMA-402 implementation, while cleaning up technical debt and improving performance and interoperability with other browsers.\nUnderlying architectural improvements #\nInitially the ECMA-402 spec was implemented mostly in JavaScript using V8-extensions and lived outside the V8 codebase. Using the external Extension API meant that several of V8’s internally used APIs for type checking, lifetime management of external C++ objects and internal private data storage couldn’t be used. As part of improving startup performance, this implementation was later moved in to the V8 codebase to enable snapshotting of these builtins.\nV8 uses specialized JSObjects with custom shapes (hidden classes) to describe built-in JavaScript objects specified by ECMAScript (like Promises, Maps, Sets, etc). With this approach, V8 can pre-allocate the required number of internal slots and generate fast accesses to these, rather than grow the object one property at a time leading to slower performance and worse memory usage.\nThe Intl implementation was not modeled after such an architecture, as a consequence of the historic split. Instead, all the built-in JavaScript objects as specified by the Internationalization spec (like NumberFormat, DateTimeFormat) were generic JSObjects that had to transition through several property additions for their internal slots.\nAnother artifact of not having a specialized JSObjects was that type checking was now more complex. The type information was stored under a private symbol and type-checked on both the JS and C++ side using expensive property access, rather than just looking up its shape.\nModernizing the code...",

      "description": "I've previously blogged about how much I like Zig's getOrPut hashmap method. As a brief recap, we can visualize Zig's hashmap as two arrays:\n  keys:               values:\n       --------          --------\n       | Paul  |         | 1234 |     @mod(hash(\"Paul\"), 5) == 0\n       --------          --------\n       |      |          |      |\n       --------          --------\n       |      |          |      |\n       --------          --------\n       | Goku |          | 9001 |    @mod(hash(\"Goku\"), 5) == 3\n       --------          --------\n       |      |          |      |\n       --------          --------\nWhen we call get(\"Paul\"), we could think of this simplified implementation:\nfn get(map: *Self, key: K) ?V {\n  const index = map.getIndexOf(key) orelse return null;\n  return map.values[index];\n}\nAnd, when we call getPtr(\"Paul\"), we'd have this implementation:\nfn getPtr(map: *Self, key: K) ?*V {\n  const index = map.getIndexOf(key) orelse return null;\n  // notice the added '&'\n  // we're taking the address of the array index\n  return &map.values[index];\n}\nBy taking the address of the value directly from the hashmap's array, we avoid copying the entire value. That can have performance implications (though not for the integer value we're using here). It also allows us to directly manipulate that slot of the array:\nconst value = map.getPtr(\"Paul\") orelse return;\nvalue.* = 10;\nThis is a powerful feature, but a dangerous one. If the underlying array changes, as can happen when items are added to the map, value would become invalid. So, while getPtr is useful, it requires mindfulness: try to minimize the scope of such references.\nCurrently, Zig's HashMap doesn't shrink when items are removed, so, for now, removing items doesn't invalidate any pointers into the hashmap. But expect that to change at some point.\nGetOrPut\ngetOrPut builds on the above concept. It returns a pointer to the value and the key, as well as creating the entry in the hashmap if necessary. For example, given...",

The\nusage of a checklist will give you a way to \"metavalidate\" your capabilities and will let you reason about the\nthe current state of the situation you are facing.\nOn \"The checklist — a tool for error management and performance improvement\", the authors of the paper bring some interesting data related to the\nusage of checklists in some fields like aviation, medicine, and product manufacturing.\nWe even have a book called \"The Checklist Manifesto\", that clarifies some ideas about the usage of checklists and the\nspread of the concept.

As commented on RSS and why I love it,\nI have an RSS feed that I use to read a lot of things during the day. But, one thing\nthat I missed was the ability to have a list of things that shall store: what I\nalready read and what I need to read (in the future, that kind of list always\nincreases).\nSo, as you can see on my bookmarks page, I have\na list containing all the content that I have consumed since January 2024, not just\narticles, but also videos, podcasts, etc. I have another page\nto see them grouped by their tags, so I can easily find a specific bookmark given\nthe tag I want.\nHow do I store my bookmarks?\nThe tool that I use to manage my bookmarks is Omnivore,\nan open-source bookmark manager and \"read-it-later\" app. For my use case, it's a\ngreat tool, I have their extension for the browser installed that I use to store\nthe tab that I'm seeing.\nAlso, I'm using their mobile app, which lets me read all bookmarks that I have.\nIn that case, I'm using it mostly to read my \"read-it-later\" articles while in\nthe gym, for example.\nAbout the list of my bookmarks\nAs mentioned before, further the list on Omnivore, I have a list of my bookmarks\ninside this blog. I have two specific ways to organize them: grouped by\nmonth and grouped by tags.\nMost of the time, I'm using it based on tags because I think that it's how my brain\nworks, so it's faster to remember what I exactly want. For example, if I want to\nread something that I didn't read yet, I can just go to the tag #for-later. If\nIf I want to recover something related to a computer science topic, I can go to the\ntag #cs ...",

I was able to\nconclude my biggest objective for this year, but looking from the personal side, I wasn't good as I expected.\nReflecting on what happened in this year, gave us some insights about what are the things that is going well and\nwhich things we will need to fix on the next year. And, in my case, I have a lot of things to fix.\nSimilar to last year, the structure of the post will be following like this: we will have some core points like \"health\",\n\"reading\", \"habits\", \"coding\", \"career\", etc. And, for this year, I'll be doing a kind of comparison to see how much\nwe improved on those ones or if we was able to maintain it.\nHealth\nIn the opposition from what I said in the expectations for 2024, I didn't take too much care from my health this year. I\nwas a lot below the average on the three critical points on health that I believe that would help me: sleep, gym and nutrition.\nSpecifically about those three points, I didn't dedicate myself enough to fit what I expected from those ones, and all those threes\nare interconnected, which had side-effects in other aspects of my life, like, for example, feeling tired during the days. In this year,\nI could see how much having an unhealth life impacts in our life and, in my case, mostly having psychological effects about it.\nFrom my experience, it was pretty hard to have a good night of sleep, staying focused for long times or even not being too stressful during the\nday.

In my case,\nbeanprice.

The SMR API allows servers to propose commands and play them back in a durable total order:\nclass SMR<Command, Result>{\n\tpublic:\n\t\t//insert a new command into the durable total order;\n\t\t//play it back and apply it on the local state machine;\n\t\t//return the result\n\t\tResult propose(Command C);\n\t\t//return once all prior commands in the durable total order\n\t\t//have been applied to the local state machine.\n\t\tvoid sync();\n\t\t//register the local state machine to receive new commands\n\t\tvoid registerApply(Applicator A);\n}\n\nTo kick things off, we make the following point: the five paradigms of replication are simply different implementations of the SMR API.\nThis is a useful observation for at least two reasons. First, an application (e.g., a database) built above the SMR API can work on any of these systems; if you need to modify your database to work over Raft rather than MultiPaxos, something went wrong in the design. Second, it implies that systems in each paradigm can be compared in a straightforward way, since they provide identical functionality.\nIn this post, we take a closer look at one particular aspect of these paradigms: modularity.\nHow modular is each implementation of SMR?\nA key question is whether systems in these paradigms use a low-level distributed abstraction as a building block. To understand this, consider an analogy to storage stacks: if someone asked you to build a filesystem, rather than implement the file API directly over hardware (e.g., sending SATA commands), you would typically layer it over a block device, which hides the complexity of HW behind a simple interface. The block API makes it easy to run filesystems over diverse hardware (e.g., SSDs vs. HD...",

      "description": "Disclaimer: This is a transcript from a 15mn recording which was supposed to be on critical thinking but immediately devolved into first principles thinking, stemming from a (very funny) screenshot sent to me in DMs\n\n1. Critical thinking is a completely different thing -- in the case of the example I used during the yap: it would be more akin of asking yourself \"what are the the different ways I could implement the hit detection in this game?\" and the process of uncovering and then fleshing these out.\n2. This is very unpolished. I just cleaned up the \"right?\", \"ums\", and endless repetitions. It's missing a lot of juicy details, like how under/over decomposition can be avoided, the kind of \"pitstop\" questions you can ask yourself, such as \"is this component's interface clear (eg clear inputs/outputs), can it be implemented independently of other components\", etc\nPlease take this for what it is: a transcript of a random 15mn rant full of \"ummms\" and wandering which I used to respond a DM.\n\nCritical thinking is pretty important when it comes to designing and building systems, but also like the day-to-day of writing code. Here's some of the things that you want to do, I guess.\nSide-note: to improve critical thinking, you also kind of want to be thinking about thinking, uh for that, I recommend Dan B's website. He's a good buddy of mine. It's a good website. Maybe just read that instead.\nSo, let's see. let's check my notes. All right. \nI'll start by talking about first principles thinking. You want to break down big problems and systems (I use systems and problems interchangeably throughout) into smaller, simpler parts -- the basic, primitive components that compose the problems or systems in question.\nSo if you're trying to build a Tetris clone, you don't want to think about the whole thing at once. You can’t start that way, it’s too big and complex. You want to think about each of the things that composes what a Tetris clone are, for example:\n\nhow you going to repre...",

Something that seemed reserved for the nerdiest programming language theorists, hardcore Haskellers, and near-schizophrenic mathematicians.\nEarlier this year, I spent a couple hours watching youtube videos on it just so I could go from 0 (\"I have no idea what it is but I have heard the name\") to 0.1 (\"I still have no idea what it actually is, but I have a general idea of the main concepts\") and double-check my intuitions. What I found is a very addictive, immensely powerful mental model that applies to countless things both in CS but also in nearly everything else. It's also fundamentally very fun to think about and do. I feel like mathematicians and computer scientists alike fall into it like a curious-minded kid falls into redstones and minecraft modding.\nAround a month ago, I finally decided to commit and jump right in, my interest having been piqued by the first video linked below. Since then, I have accumulated many a talk paper and book and I wanted to have a place to stash it all and so here we are.\nYou can skip may ahead if you're only interested in the resources.\nWhy It Grabbed MeFor me, Category Theory has been one of these things where, once you learn about it, you can literally see it everywhere. Everything starts looking like morphisms between objects and functors between categories. I have found the overwhelming majority of the ideas in it to be truly, deeply intuitive. It's still a work in progress to have a real sense of how immensely powerful they are, and my definition of the \"essence of category theory\" is still getting new shades every week.\nOverall, it did help me sank in two immensely important things, that were previously only intuitions: the power of abstraction and composition\nI have started writing a lot more about abstraction and the expressive powers it enables to try and synthesize my thoughts.

Category Theory is traditionally a small branch of Mathematics and a reprint in TAC is an accomplishment.Together with Volume 40 - Bunge Festschrift* and the donation of Marta's Library to USP, SP in\n Brazil, this completes a multi-year project that hoped to showcase the \nachievements of Prof Bunge in a very male-oriented environment. Marta\n was a good friend and, like many women I know, one that did not believe\n very much in the impact of her work. When I first told her that I \nwanted to get a volume dedicated to the whole of her oeuvre,\n the first thing she said was that she was not sure she deserved it. But\n of course she did and many members of our community wanted to celebrate\n her work. Thus it was nice to be able to see the volume 40 of TAC, \ncelebrating her work. Especially nice to see the remembrances of Marta \nfrom Prof Andrée C. Ehresmann and Prof Silvia Bunge, her daughter.Maria Manuel Clementino, Jonathon Funk (one of her earlier PhD students) and I had the pleasure of editing the volume. Many thanks Maria Manuel and Jonathon! It\n was very sad that a few months after we started thinking about the \nfestschrift, Marta fell ill and did not live to see the volume in her \nhonour. She died on 25 October 2022. I've asked mathematicians about other ways of celebrating her work and Nathanael Arkor suggested producing an online version of her original PhD thesis from 1966. Prof Michael Barr and Pam Freyd, as well as Silvia and Eric Bunge\n worked  hard to get a copy of the thesis from which Nathanael could \nwork, and very soon Nathanael had a first version of the reprint done. \nThis needed some support from editors of TAC to be accepted and Maria \nManuel and Matias Menni were happy to lend their support to t...",

This was excellent, but quite a bit of work.  (I was going to post one of the many lovely pictures of our program, but reading Hausdorff's history there, I think I prefer to have him instead. He was really impressive!) There was also the great week in Oxford for 40th MFPS and ACT 2024.

      "description": "Writing blog posts can be very useful. Sometimes. It helps you sort out your own ideas and it helps you communicate these ideas to someone who hasn't been part of the process of developing them. It can also help the group of people developing the ideas to get a better understanding of how pieces of a project fit together. Finally it can be very useful as a way of tidying up several thoughts, usually represented by papers, that you know are connected, but whose exact connection escapes you.I have been writing in this blog on and off since 2011. This is an awful long time now. I hear younger friends dismissing the idea of blogs as something from a bygone era, something antiquated and abandoned like Orkut or Geocities. But for myself I do find the blogs of friends, or of  people I admire (like Terry Tao) extremely helpful. They tell you what you need to know, trying to be as easily  and friendly as they can be. My blog also reminds of things I want/need to know, so it's a shame that I haven't written much recently. I have been using my blog recently though. I have been reminding myself of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and its artifacts.  Because now I want to do it for mathematical texts, using LLMs and I sure had forgotten some of the lessons learned in the past. I started working on NLI in 2016, when Google produced its \"we solved parsing\" blog post. It's odd to read, 8 years later, the triumphalism of \"The World’s Most Accurate Parser Goes Open Source\". But hype can be very convincing and learning that they had open-sourced their parser I decided to try to see how far simply bag-of-concepts could get us when reasoning with sentences of the SICK corpus. That work with Alexandre and Fabricio never got written, but a series of papers with Katerina and Livy did get written and presented. I blog post was written about some of the issues with that line of work and a journal paper was written about the line of work itself.So here I want to make a list of the new work...",

(the full text of the interview is found in the link above) What is Topos from a very high level?Topos is a new structure for doing research for the public benefit.  In pursuit of this goal, we combine a focus on fundamental, long-term research similar to a university with a theory of dynamic change similar to a tech startup.The technical area we work in is mathematics and computer science — particularly in collective modeling, collective inquiry, and cooperating in situations that are incredibly complex and multidisciplinary. We do this as a nonprofit whose work is supported by grants and contracts from groups like DARPA, ARIA, philanthropic foundations, technical firms, and gifts from high-net-worth individuals.Can you talk more about collective modeling  and how that drives Topos’ grand technical vision?Topos works on projects in areas like climate modeling, the systems engineering of large airplanes, ensuring AI systems are resistant to catastrophic risks, etc. The communities contributing to each of these technical systems are made up of a variety of technical experts navigating different aspects of the system with their own overlapping models — which often have their own merits and their own limitations.Topos works on projects with specific user communities. That keeps us grounded in the practicalities, ensuring we don’t get too caught up solving problems we find beautiful but are only modestly connected to practical needs. We want to build a tool that helps a variety of users reason across situations with the richness and complexity that comes with combining and interpreting a mix of overlapping models of the world. One difference between this general modeling environment we hope to build that we want to empower our users to represent the world in the conceptual language they use in the...",

It is also humbling to go over my stand up notes from all these years: the many things I wished I had done, I thought I would do, and also the many things I did and promptly forgot about. Some weeks can be very hard and others look like nothing has happened. (I wanted us to have weekly stand ups at the beginning, but Brendan and David thought that fortnightly was more than enough. In hindsight, I think they were right, our kind of research is slower than some others.) Last year I spent almost three months in Germany, at the Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics in our Trimester Program: \"Prospects of Formal Mathematics\" and the stand ups and notes from it were even more helpful -- 9 hours time difference is hard to deal with.  I do need to write a series of blog posts about the program, what I hope we've achieved and what is still to do, but for the time being I will just post this picture of the \"Women in Formal Math\" meeting as part of our program.Recently the Topos stand-ups have been renamed \"All Hands\" and we had the biggest one ever last week, as Topos Research Oxford is now a reality. Here's a picture, taken by Brendan: This milestone (we're three times as big as when we started) and Brendan's interview to Eric Gilliam in freaktakes, made me feel like going over some of my hopes and expectations for Topos.

There are three types of network effects: direct, indirect, and data network effects. While network effects can be powerful, they are not always as defensible as they seem. Examples like Friendster and MySpace losing ground to Facebook show that network effects can be a growth mechanism for new entrants rather than a defensibility mechanism for incumbents. Additionally, atom-based network effects in industries like telephones and railroads have greater defensibility due to switching and multihoming costs. The concept of defaults is also important in establishing dominance within a stack, as seen with Apple's pre-installed apps and Google paying to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. The identity layer is another crucial layer in the stack, with companies like Facebook and LinkedIn vying to become the default identity layer.

      "description": "My wrist has been hurting a little bit recently, and a friend of mine has been telling me about how he's using Talon (and its extensions Cursorless and Rango) as an interface to programming entirely with his voice, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm now about three days into using it, and I have it working well enough that I just composed my first real patch that makes a not completely trivial change to a program, and while it took me almost an entire workday to complete a 165-line patch, I can definitely feel myself accelerating and gaining fluency in the way the system works.(This blogpost is also being mostly composed using Talon)Some notes about limitations and experiences so far:- Talon is extremely oriented towards programmers.- Cursorless even more so, I don't think it works on anything except VSCode.- Talon, Cursorless and Rango are all seemingly being developed by different people, and to some extent they fight over their definitions of words and commands. This is most evident in things like Cursorless anchoring its cut and paste commands in weird synonyms like \"carve\", \"chuck\" and \"bring\".- By far the most annoying instance of this is the fact that you have to refer to \"line\"s as \"row\"s in some contexts but not others, and if you get it wrong the command recognition system doesn't work properly and you just wind up in putting a garbage command and everything gets mangled by a mis-parsed bulk command.- It's also evident in several phrase level inconsistencies, such as subject verb object ordering varying between the packages and even sometimes within packages, or the use of counting words with or without ordinal suffixes (sometimes you have to say three, other times you have to say third, in extremely unnatural contexts like \"tab next third\").- There are also just a bunch of cutesy words that seem to be chosen for no reason other than they are cute: surely it is not any easier for the voice recognizer to hear the word \"hunt\" than it would be to hear th...",

I spent a bunch of time with a lacrosse ball (hint: these are the best muscle-release massage equipment in the entire world and are also very cheap and convenient) and it seems to be mostly fixed now? So my actual motivation to keep working with talon has gone from relatively-pressing to moderate-residual-curiosity and I'm mostly just typing again now.

      "description": "Today I was asked -- as I am frequently asked! -- about the origins of something in Rust. In this case the origin of the \"borrow\" terminology. Not the idea, just the word. Who first used that word?The short answer to this is \"as far as I know, John Boyland, in his 1999 paper Alias killing: Unique variables without destructive reads\" (later expanded-on in a more widely cited 2000 paper where he renamed it to the slightly less dramatic \"alias burying\").John's paper was read by and influenced the Cyclone folks somewhere between 2002 and 2007. And both of these works were read by and influenced Niko Matsakis when he proposed upgrading Rust's existing and somewhat half-baked alias checker into something resembling today's region/lifetime/borrowing system (at the time this was motivated by soundness issues emerging from interactions with Rust's at-the-time half-baked mutability rules, creating the so-called \"Dan's Bug\").This was not impossible to find -- I know a few extra places to look mind you -- but digging it up produced a couple surprises to me:I thought -- and nearly answered the person asking me -- that one of us in the Rust project had coined the term \"borrow\" as an ergonomic adaptation, because \"region\" and \"alias\" are clunky and nonintuitive. This was a retcon on my part! Easy to imagine, but wrong.Even more interesting to me is how many other works there are in the Related Works section of John's paper! Not just things I've seen before[1] (eg. Cyclone, Tofte & Talpin's ML Kit, Ada, Euclid[2]) but also a spectrum of delightfully weird others: Eiffel*, Islands, Balloons, FAP, ESC with its \"virgin, pivot and plenary\" references, etc. This reference-set pulls at threads happening in multiple teams/projects/institutions, all through the 90s, 80s, even back into the 1970s, eg. here is Reynolds grappling with it in 1978.Now, I don't want to minimize Niko's work here at all -- he's responsible for doing the lion's share of detailed design and implementation work on...",

      "description": "In the previous section, I’ve given a formal definition of the programming\nlanguage that I’ve been trying to analyze. This formal definition serves\nas the “ground truth” for how our little imperative programs are executed;\nhowever, program analyses (especially in practice) seldom take the formal\nsemantics as input. Instead, they focus on more pragmatic program\nrepresentations from the world of compilers. One such representation are\nControl Flow Graphs (CFGs). That’s what I want to discuss in this post.\nLet’s start by building some informal intuition. CFGs are pretty much what\ntheir name suggests: they are a type of graph\n\n;\ntheir edges show how execution might jump from one piece of code to\nanother (how control might flow).\nFor example, take the below program.\nx = ...;\nif x {\n  x = 1;\n} else {\n  x = 0;\n}\ny = x;\nThe CFG might look like this:\n\n\nHere, the initialization of x with ..., as well as the if condition (just x),\nare guaranteed to execute one after another, so they occupy a single node. From there,\ndepending on the condition, the control flow can jump to one of the\nbranches of the if statement: the “then” branch if the condition is truthy,\nand the “else” branch if the condition is falsy. As a result, there are two\narrows coming out of the initial node. Once either branch is executed, control\nalways jumps to the code right after the if statement (the y = x). Thus,\nboth the x = 1 and x = 0 nodes have a single arrow to the y = x node.\nAs another example, if you had a loop:\nx = ...;\nwhile x {\n  x = x - 1;\n}\ny = x;\nThe CFG would look like this:\n\n\nHere, the condition of the loop (x) is not always guaranteed to execute together\nwith the code that initializes x. That’s because the condition of the loop\nis checked after every iteration, whereas the code before the loop is executed\nonly once. As a result, x = ... and x occupy distinct CFG nodes. From there,\nthe control flow can proceed in two different ways, depending on the value\nof x. If x is truthy, the program wi...",

These are precise rules\nthat describe how programs are executed. These serve as the source of truth\nfor what each statement and expression does.\nBecause they are the source of truth, they capture all information about\nhow programs are executed. To determine that a program starts in one\nenvironment and ends in another (getting a judgement \\(\\rho_1, s \\Rightarrow \\rho_2\\)),\nwe need to actually run the program. In fact, our Agda definitions\nencoding the semantics actually produce proof trees, which contain every\nsingle step of the program’s execution.\n\n\nIn part 6, I covered\nControl Flow Graphs (CFGs), which in short arranged code into a structure\nthat represents how execution moves from one statement or expression to the\nnext.\nUnlike the semantics, CFGs do not capture a program’s entire execution;\nthey merely contain the possible orders in which statements can be evaluated.\nInstead of capturing the exact number of iterations performed by a while\nloop, they encode repetition as cycles in the graph. Because they are\nmissing some information, they’re more of an approximation of a program’s\nbehavior.\n\n\nOur analyses operate on CFGs, but it is our semantics that actually determine\nhow a program behaves. In order for our analyses to be able to produce correct\nresults, we need to make sure that there isn’t a disconnect between the\napproximation and the truth. In the previous post, I stated the property I will\nuse to establish the connection between the two perspectives:\n\nFor each possible execution of a program according to its semantics,\nthere exists a corresponding path through the graph.\n\nBy ensuring this property, we will guarantee that our Control Flow Graphs\naccount for anything that might happen.

Amidst beers, fries, and overpriced\nsandwiches, the professor and I were talking about dependent types\n\n. Speaking\nloosely and imprecisely, these are types that are somehow constructed from\nvalues in a language, like numbers.\nFor example, in C++, std::array\n\n\nis a dependent type. An instantiation of the type array, like array<string, 3>\nis constructed from the type of its elements (here, string) and a value\nrepresenting the number of elements (here, 3). This is in contrast with types\nlike std::vector, which only depends on a type (e.g., vector<string> would\nbe a dynamically-sized collection of strings).\nI was extolling the virtues of general dependent types, like you might find\nin Idris\n\n or Agda\n\n:\nmore precise function signatures! The\n\nCurry-Howard isomorphism!\n[note:\nThe Curry-Howard isomorphism is a common theme on this blog. I've\n\nwritten about it myself, but you can also take a look at the\n\nWikipedia page.\n]\n\n\n The professor was skeptical. He had been excited about\ndependent types in the past, but nowadays he felt over them. They were cool, he\nsaid, but there are few practical uses. In fact, he posed a challenge:\nGive me one good reason to use dependent types in practice that doesn’t\ninvolve keeping track of bounds for lists and matrices!\nThis challenge alludes to fixed-length lists – vectors\n\n\n– which are one of the first dependently-typed data structures one learns about.\nMatrices are effectively vectors-of-vectors. In fact, even in giving my introductory\nexample above, I demonstrated the C++ equivalent of a fixed-length list, retroactively\nsupporting the professor’s point.\nIt’s not particularly important to write down how I addressed the challenge;\nsuffice it to say that the notion resonated with some of the other\nstudents present in the pub.

      "description": "Transaction isolation levels can have unexpected behavior, and it's important to understand and test them. Weak transaction isolation levels, such as Read Committed, allow for non-repeatable reads, where queries to the same column may return different results within the same transaction. This can lead to domain logic bugs and incorrect values. Testing for transaction isolation anomalies can be challenging, as it requires simulating concurrent connections. One way to address this is by avoiding multiple reads and passing in a sampled balance value instead. Another issue that can arise is race conditions, which can result in incorrect balances. Serializability, ensuring that transactions adhere to a specific order, can help prevent these issues. Locking rows with FOR UPDATE can be a simple way to address race conditions and maintain data integrity.",

Specialization is performed to retain rows that match a specific value or constructor, while defaulting produces a matrix that includes rows for constructors or values not already present. The algorithm also includes operations such as swapping columns and recursive case analysis.

      "description": "I’ve been meaning to write this one for a while, but the announcement of the\nLadybird Browser Initiative makes now a particularly good time.\nTL;DR: Chrome is eating the web. I have wanted to\nhelp fund a serious alternative browser for quite some time, and while\nFirefox remains the largest potential alternative, Mozilla has never let\nme. Since I can’t fund Firefox, I’m going to show there’s money in\nuser-funded web browsers by funding Ladybird instead. You\nshould too.\n\nWhy Browser Diversity\nMatters\nAn open web requires a healthy ecosystem of several competing\nbrowsers, where each has enough market share that no one vendor has de\nfacto control over web standards. That’s the world we used to have,\nafter Firefox cracked the dominance of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer\n(IE) in the 1990s. IE’s poor support for internet standards held back\nweb development all through the late 1990s and early 2000s, and\ncompetition from Firefox allowed developers to build “for the web”\ninstead of “for IE6”, forcing browser vendors to catch up.\nUnfortunately, we are back in a world without healthy browser\ncompetition. statcounter.com\nclaims that Chrome, Google’s browser, has over 65% market share. Add\nEdge (which uses Blink, Chrome’s browser engine, under the hood) and\nyou’re over 70%. This market dominance allows Google to push through\nchanges like its “Manifest V3” format for browser extensions, which\ncoincidentally cripples ad\nblockers.\n\n\nSidebar: Ad companies had their chance\n\nWhile a discussion of the economics of ad-supported sites is outside\nthe scope of this post, someone will ask “don’t you like free things on\nthe internet?” if I don’t address it first.\nOnline advertising has become so obnoxious that ad blockers are\nall-but-necessary for users to get anything done online. More than that,\nI feel obliged to install ad blockers on family computers that I\nsupport: skipping all those megabytes of random advertising JavaScript\nsignificantly extends the lifespan of older computers and sto...",

Perma-nomad\nVitalik Buterin has his own take on living\nout of a 40L backpack; one of his key points is to run everything\nyou can off of USB-C. The benefits should be obvious: you cut down the\nnumber of charging cables you need to carry and your power bank can\nrecharge any of your devices. While I’m a bit of a luddite, I can see a\nlot of people travelling with at least a laptop and phone, and possibly\nalso a tablet, earbuds, and/or a smartwatch, all of which need\npower.\nVitalik’s guide mentions a USB-C “wall wart” charger that he uses to\npower his stuff. I disagree with this choice, at least for international\ntravel: I think you want a desktop USB-C charger that takes an\nIEC C7\n(“figure 8”) cable.\nI’m not aware of any good articles that spell out the “desktop\ncharger + replaceable cable” trick and how to actually find a suitable\none, so a full explanation, research procedure, and some tentative\nrecommendations are spelled out in laborious detail after the jump.\n\nWhy a “desktop” charger?\nI am specifically writing about “desktop”-style USB-C chargers with\nan interchangeable mains cable. For travel, a charger with a mains cable\nhas a few big advantages over a “wall wart”:\n\nOlder outlets sometimes do a poor job of gripping the pins of a\nmains plug. The weight of a wall wart can cause it to fall away from the\nwall where a lighter mains plug will happily remain connected;\nA small plug will be able to reach into recessed power outlets\nwhere a wall wart might not fit; and\nWall warts are often quite wide and block multiple outlets on a\npower board, getting in the way of other plugs.\n\nA charger with interchangeable cables lets me purchase the shor...",

      "description": "When I was younger, I played a lot of MUDs (“Multi-User\nDungeons” — the text-only predecessor to modern MMORPGs, often\nplayed over Telnet).\nThey were great fun, particularly during high school: a lightweight\nmultiplayer game with no client state meant you could log in from any\nmachine in any lab, even Windows shipped a Telnet client in those days,\nthe Telnet protocol was light enough to run on my school’s slow PCs and\nlimited internet connection, and the lack of flashy graphics meant it\nwas easy to hide the window from a passing teacher or librarian.\nAt some point, building and tinkering with MUDs became more\ninteresting than playing them. In those days, MUD builders and wizards\n(admins) were often recruited from each game’s playerbase, and many MUDs\nlet builders edit the world through in-game commands. This was\nincredibly cool at the time — even through a clumsy line-oriented (ed-style)\neditor, there was something magical about summoning blank rooms from the\nvoid, writing rich descriptions to turn them into “real” spaces, and\nadding items and “mobs” (Mobile OBJects — NPCs) to make them come to\nlife. A few of my friends and I signed up to a “builder academy” MUD,\nwhere everyone got a zone to mess around in, and we tried our hand at\ncrafting our own areas. Most of these projects didn’t get very far, and\nall of them have been lost to time.\nThere’s only so much you can do with builder rights on someone else’s\nMUD. To really change the game, you needed to be able to code, and most\nMUDs were written “real languages” like C. We’d managed to get a copy of\nVisual C++ 6 and the CircleMUD\nsource code, and started messing about. But the development cycle was\npretty frustrating — for every change, you had to recompile the server,\nshut it down (dropping everyone’s connections), bring it back up, and\nwait for everyone to log back in.\nSome MUDs used a very cool trick to avoid this, called “copyover” or\n“hotboot”.

A lot of this will work on\nWindows or macOS too; it’s just the C♯ build steps that are really\nLinux-specific, as are various pathnames etc.\nRimWorld mods consist of two parts:\n\n\nA set of XML definitions (“Defs”) which defines everything from items, actions\nyou can take, research projects, weather, etc. This is the “glue” that\nactually makes stuff appear in the game, applies effects, etc.\nFor (very) simple mods this may actually be enough, and no “real” coding is\nrequired. You can use XML files to both add new stuff, and RimWorld has\nfacilities to patch existing in-game content.\n\n\nC♯ code which either adds entire new stuff, or monkey-patches existing code.\n\n\nAs an example we’ll make a little mod that makes it rain blood. Why? It seemed\neasy enough to do while also exploring some of the core concepts. Also, I was\nplaying Slayer when I started on this. The complete example mod is on\nGitHub, but I encourage people to modify things manually (and maybe play\naround with things a bit) rather than copy/paste stuff from there; it’s just a\nbetter way to learn things.\nGetting started \nBefore we start with the C♯ stuff let’s set up a basic mod which adds a new\nweather type; we just need to edit some XML for this.\nMods are located in the Mods/ directory in your RimWorld installation\ndirectory; I’m using the version I bought from the RimWorld website and\nextracted to ~/rimworld so that’s nice and simple. GOG.com games usually store\nthe actual game data in a game/ subdirectory, and I don’t know where Steam\nstores things 🤷\nThis directory should already exist with a Mods/Place mods here.txt.

      "description": "Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t just come to me in a vision—I have an iterative design process that doesn’t require plucking the “right” approach out of thin air—yet I haven’t been very successful in communicating that process to others.However, about a month ago, I was reflecting on Twitter about the differences I experienced parsing JSON in statically- and dynamically-typed languages, and finally, I realized what I was looking for. Now I have a single, snappy slogan that encapsulates what type-driven design means to me, and better yet, it’s only three words long:Parse, don’t validate.The essence of type-driven designAlright, I’ll confess: unless you already know what type-driven design is, my catchy slogan probably doesn’t mean all that much to you. Fortunately, that’s what the remainder of this blog post is for. I’m going to explain precisely what I mean in gory detail—but first, we need to practice a little wishful thinking.The realm of possibilityOne of the wonderful things about static type systems is that they can make it possible, and sometimes even easy, to answer questions like “is it possible to write this function?” For an extreme example, consider the following Haskell type signature:foo :: Integer -> VoidIs it possible to implement foo? Trivially, the answer is no, as Void is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for any function to produce a value of type Void.1 That example is pretty boring, but the question gets much more interesting if we choose a more realistic example:head :: [a] -> aThis function returns the first element from a list. Is it possible to implement? It certainly doesn’t sound like it does anything very complicated, but if we attempt to implement it, the compiler won’t be satisfied:head :: [a] -> a\nh...",

      "description": "Internet debates about typing disciplines continue to be plagued by a pervasive myth that dynamic type systems are inherently better at modeling “open world” domains. The argument usually goes like this: the goal of static typing is to pin everything down as much as possible, but in the real world, that just isn’t practical. Real systems should be loosely coupled and worry about data representation as little as possible, so dynamic types lead to a more robust system in the large.This story sounds compelling, but it isn’t true. The flaw is in the premise: static types are not about “classifying the world” or pinning down the structure of every value in a system. The reality is that static type systems allow specifying exactly how much a component needs to know about the structure of its inputs, and conversely, how much it doesn’t. Indeed, in practice static type systems excel at processing data with only a partially-known structure, as they can be used to ensure application logic doesn’t accidentally assume too much.Two typing fallaciesI’ve wanted to write this blog post for a while, but what finally made me decide to do it were misinformed comments responding to my previous blog post. Two comments in particular caught my eye, the first of which was posted on /r/programming:Strongly disagree with the post […] it promotes a fundamentally entangled and static view of the world. It assumes that we can or should theorize about what is \"valid\" input at the edge between the program and the world, thus introducing a strong sense of coupling through the entire software, where failure to conform to some schema will automatically crash the program.This is touted as a feature here but imagine if the internet worked like this. A server changes their JSON output, and we need to recompile and reprogram the entire internet. This is the static view that is promoted as a feature here. […] The \"parser mentality\" is fundamentally rigid and global, whereas robust system design should...",

      "description": "Just what exactly is a type?A common perspective is that types are restrictions. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t really predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.But that is not the only perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves you.…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.Seeing the types half-emptyLet’s talk a little about TypeScript.TypeScript is a gradually-typed language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to gradually add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as...",

      "description": "Haskell programmers spend a lot of time talking about type safety. The Haskell school of program construction advocates “capturing invariants in the type system” and “making illegal states unrepresentable,” both of which sound like compelling goals, but are rather vague on the techniques used to achieve them. Almost exactly one year ago, I published Parse, Don’t Validate as an initial stab towards bridging that gap.The ensuing discussions were largely productive and right-minded, but one particular source of confusion quickly became clear: Haskell’s newtype construct. The idea is simple enough—the newtype keyword declares a wrapper type, nominally distinct from but representationally equivalent to the type it wraps—and on the surface this sounds like a simple and straightforward path to type safety. For example, one might consider using a newtype declaration to define a type for an email address:newtype EmailAddress = EmailAddress TextThis technique can provide some value, and when coupled with a smart constructor and an encapsulation boundary, it can even provide some safety. But it is a meaningfully distinct kind of type safety from the one I highlighted a year ago, one that is far weaker. On its own, a newtype is just a name.And names are not type safety.Intrinsic and extrinsic safetyTo illustrate the difference between constructive data modeling (discussed at length in my previous blog post) and newtype wrappers, let’s consider an example. Suppose we want a type for “an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.” The natural constructive modeling would be an enumeration with five cases:data OneToFive\n  = One\n  | Two\n  | Three\n  | Four\n  | FiveWe could then write some functions to convert between Int and our OneToFive type:toOneToFive :: Int -> Maybe OneToFive\ntoOneToFive 1 = Just One\ntoOneToFive 2 = Just Two\ntoOneToFive 3 = Just Three\ntoOneToFive 4 = Just Four\ntoOneToFive 5 = Just Five\ntoOneToFive _ = Nothing\n\nfromOneToFive :: OneToFive -> Int\nfromOneToFive One   = ...",

Despite having the extremely obvious-in-retrospect data in front of me, I wasted a lot of time speeding up code that turned out to not move the needle at all.\nAlthough perhaps it will be interesting only to future me, I thought it would be a good exercise to write up the experience—if only so I learn the lesson about how to read profiles and not make the same mistake again.\nSome Context\nI’m currently employed to work on a compiler. The performance has never been stellar, in that we were usually seeing about 5s to compile programs, even trivially small ones consisting of less than a hundred instructions. It was painful, but not that painful, since the test suite still finished in a minute or two. It was a good opportunity to get a coffee. I always assumed that the time penalties we were seeing were constant factors; perhaps it took a second or two to connect to Z3 or something like that.\nBut then we started unrolling loops, which turned trivially small programs into merely small programs, and our performance ballooned. Now we were looking at 45s for some of our tests! Uh oh! That’s no longer in the real of constant factors, and it was clear that something asymptotically was wrong.\nSo I fired up GHC with the trusty old -prof flag, and ran the test suite in +RTS -p mode, which instruments the program with all sorts of profiling goodies. After a few minutes, the test suite completed, and left a test-suite.prof file laying around in the current directory. You can inspect such things by hand, but tools like profiteur make the experience much nicer.\nWithout further ado, here’s what our profile looked like:\nMAIN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%\nWell, that’s not very helpful. Of course MAIN takes 100% of the time. So I expanded that, and saw:\nMAIN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%\n└ main . . . . . . . . . ...",

      "description": "I’ve always considered lenses to be a bit uncomfortable. While they’re occasionally useful for doing deeply nested record updates, they often seem to be more trouble than they’re worth. There’s a temptation in the novice programmer, to ^.. and folded their way to a solution that is much more naturally written merely as toList. And don’t get me started about the stateful operators like <<+= and their friends. Many programs which can be more naturally written functionally accidentally end up being imperative due to somebody finding a weird lens combinator and trying to use it in anger. Much like a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.\nThus, my response has usually been one of pushback and moderation. I don’t avoid lenses at all costs, but I do try to limit myself to the prime types (Lens', Prism', Iso'), and to the boring combinators (view, set, over). I feel like these give me most of the benefits of lenses, without sending me tumbling down the rabbit hole.\nAll of this is to say that my grokkage of lenses has always been one of generalized injections and projections, for a rather shallow definition of “generalized”. That is, I’ve grown accustomed to thinking about lenses as getter/setter pairs for data structures—eg, I’ve got a big product type and I want to pull a smaller piece out of it, or modify a smaller piece in a larger structure. I think about prisms as the dual structure over coproducts—“generalized” injecting and pattern matching.\nAnd this is all true; but I’ve been missing the forest for the trees on this one. That’s not to say that I want to write lensier code, but that I should be taking the “generalized” part much more seriously.\nThe big theme of my intellectual development over the last few years has been thinking about abstractions as shared vocabularies. Monoids are not inherently interesting; they’re interesting because of how they let you quotient seemingly-unrelated problems by their monoidal structure. Applicat...",

      "description": "There’s a common anti-pattern I see in beginner-to-intermediate Haskell programmers that I wanted to discuss today. It’s the tendency to conceptualize the creation of an object by repeated mutation. Often this takes the form of repeated insertion into an empty container, but comes up under many other guises as well.\nThis anti-pattern isn’t particularly surprising in its prevalence; after all, if you’ve got the usual imperative brainworms, this is just how things get built. The gang of four “builder pattern” is exactly this; you can build an empty object, and setters on such a thing change the state but return the object itself. Thus, you build things by chaning together setter methods:\nFoo myFoo = new Foo().setBar().setQux(17).setZap(true);\nEven if you don’t ascribe to the whole OOP design principle thing, you’re still astronomically likely to think about building data structures like this:\nDoodad doodad = new Doodad;\nforeach (Widget widget in widgets) {\n  doodad.addWidget(widget);\n}\nTo be more concrete, maybe instead of doodads and widgets you have BSTs and Nodes. Or dictionaries and key-value pairs. Or graphs and edges. Anywhere you look, you’ll probably find examples of this sort of code.\nMaybe you’re thinking to yourself “I’m a hairy-chested functional programmer and I scoff at patterns like these.” That might be true, but perhaps you too are guilty of writing code that looks like:\nfoldr\n    (\\(k, v) m -> Map.insert k v m)\n    Map.empty\n  $ toKVPairs something\nJust because it’s dressed up with functional combinators doesn’t mean you’re not still writing C code. To my eye, the great promise of functional programming is its potential for conceptual clarity, and repeated mutation will always fall short of the mark.\nThe complaint, as usual, is that repeated mutation tells you how to build something, rather than focusing on what it is you’re building. An algorithm cannot be correct in the absence of intention—after all, you must know what you’re trying to accompli...",

      "description": "This post is part six of the series Raw Nerve.\nThis is a tale of two nonprofits.\nAt one, they hate making mistakes. How else could it be? “We’re not ever going to enjoy screwing up,” they told me. But this attitude has a lot of consequences. Everything they do has to go through several layers of approval to make sure it’s not a mistake. And when someone does screw up, they try to hide it.\nIt’s only natural — you know you’re going to get in trouble for screwing up, so you try to fix it before anyone notices. And if you can’t do, then your boss or your boss’s boss tries. And if no one in the organization can fix it, and it goes all the way to the executive director, then he tries to figure out a way to keep it from the press or spin it appropriately, so the world never finds out they made a mistake.\nAt the other nonprofit, they have a very different attitude. You notice it the first time you visit their website. Right in their navigation bar, at the top of every page, is a link labeled “Mistakes.” Click it and you’ll find a list of all the things they screwed up, starting with the most horribly embarrassing one (they once promoted their group under false names).\nAnd it goes on to discuss mistakes big and small, core and peripheral. They previously used flaky phones that would cut out during a call, annoying people. They were insufficiently skeptical in some of the most important claims they made. At times, their admissions have the tone of a chastised teenager forced to write an apology, but together they provide a remarkable record of all the mistakes, both crucial and mundane, you might reasonably make when starting something new.\nIt’s not that this group likes making mistakes — you can feel the annoyance and embarrassment seeping through the page — but they don’t shirk from them either. They identify their mistake, admit them publicly, and devise steps to avoid them next time. They use it as an opportunity to get better.\n\nI wrote before about Carol Dweck’s studi...",

      "description": "This post is part seven of the series Raw Nerve.\nThe General Motors plant in Fremont was a disaster. “Everything was a fight,” the head of the union admits. “They spent more time on grievances and on things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly. … It was considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States.”\n“One of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM plant in Fremont,” adds Jeffrey Liker, a professor who studied the plant. “If you want sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it’s there. During breaks, during lunch time, if you want to gamble illegally—any illegal activity was available for the asking within that plant.” Absenteeism was so bad that some mornings they didn’t have enough employees to start the assembly line; they had to go across the street and drag people out of the bar.\nWhen management tried to punish workers, workers tried to punish them right back: scratching cars, loosening parts in hard-to-reach places, filing union grievances, sometimes even building cars unsafely. It was war.\nIn 1982, GM finally closed the plant. But the very next year, when Toyota was planning to start its first plant in the US, it decided to partner with GM to reopen it, hiring back the same old disastrous workers into the very same jobs. And so began the most fascinating experiment in management history.\nToyota flew this rowdy crew to Japan, to see an entirely different way of working: The Toyota Way. At Toyota, labor and management considered themselves on the same team; when workers got stuck, managers didn’t yell at them, but asked how they could help and solicited suggestions. It was a revelation. “You had union workers—grizzled old folks that had worked on the plant floor for 30 years, and they were hugging their Japanese counterparts, just absolutely in tears,” recalls their Toyota trainer. “And it might sound flowery to say 25 years later, but t...",

      "description": "First off, go see Looper. One of the best movies I’ve seen. Spoilers follow.\nOK, let’s start by explaining how a looper’s career is supposed to look. You get hired as a looper, spend your time sitting in a corn field shooting people, eventually shoot yourself and get a big payday, live off of it for thirty more years, then get kidnapped and sent back in time and shot by yourself. Notice that this is a stable timeloop: young you grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old … etc.\nBut time travel doesn’t eliminate free will. We see this with the case of Seth (Paul Dano / Frank Brennan). Instead of shooting Old Seth, Young Seth decides to let him escape. This too is a stable timeloop: young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while … .\nBut other characters have free will too: young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to give young Seth up. The gang cuts off one of young Seth’s fingers, pushing him into a new timeloop: young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, while young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, etc. With each new choice by the gang to let old Seth change young Seth’s future (and thus old Seth’s past), we head into a new timeloop, where old Seth has a different past (and thus different memories and different missing limbs).\nIn the first main timeloop (shown second in the movie, via a flashback), young Joe shoots old Joe, goes to China, becomes an unusually-talented agent of violence, finds true love, is kidnapped and sent back in time, and gets killed by young Joe, who goes on to do the same thing. This too is a nice stable timeloop.\nBut on one of these runs through the loop, old Joe manages to overpower the guards and, while he does go back in time, he manages to keep young Joe from killing him. He escapes into...",

The films are mirror images, one about the failure of liberal policies; the other about the failure of conservative policies. In this sense, The Dark Knight is truly the final film in this nihilistic trilogy, documenting the hopelessness of anything outside that usual left-right struggle.\nFrom the start, the city is torn about how to handle the Batman, who has inspired a wave of second-rate imitators. Some believe it’s wrong to be idolizing a masked vigilante, but most (including the new DA, Harvey Dent) approve of his results.\nDent is doing his own part to lock up the criminals, working inside the system. He’s arrested all the mob bankers (except Lau) and is now going after the gangsters themselves, starting with mob boss Maroni (who took over for mob boss Falcone). But while the prosecutions bring him a great deal of political attention, they don’t seem to achieve much in the way of concrete results — new gangsters spring up to take the place of whoever Dent arrests.\nDent decides the only way to win is to go big — really big. He arrests everyone at once, on charges that are unlikely to stick. Dent doesn’t care that he’s breaking the rules, as long as it solves the problem. He cites the Romans who suspended democracy to protect their city. (Although, as Rachel points out, they ended up losing democracy.) “You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,” Dent explains. He hopes to take up Batman’s mantle, but do it from inside the system.\nBut, as the mayor explains, Dent isn’t just taking on his own sense of ethics, he’s taking on the entire system: “the mob, politicians, journalists, cops — anyone whose wallet’s about to get lighter”. If he fails, both of the...",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\nNew essays\n\nI'm terrified of old people.\nI'm broke, divorced, and unemployed. By any reasonable measure, I'm probably the worst person in the world to ask for advice.\n\nLinks\n\nSix Victorian marriages, part 1: Jane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle\nOn Biden-Obama relationship.\n\"I was Mike Tyson’s hardest fight despite $150-a-day heroin addiction and gangster life\"\n\nWhat I've been reading\n\nAnna: The Biography by Amy Odell. Very good.\nThe Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes. One of the few books I keep thinking about many years after I first read it. Re-reading now and appreciating it more than ever before.\nDignity by Chris Arnade. Difficult but rewarding. I can't stop feeling that Arnade isn't willing to go all the way and be fully serious and this prevents him from really understanding the people he's writing about.\nRising Star: The Making of Barack Obama by David Garrow. Obsessively, ridiculously, gratuitously detailed, yet remains engaging throughout. This is what Caro's books should've been like.\nStubborn Attachments by Tyler Cowen. I very much enjoyed the books \"to-the-point\" style and the defense it offered to common sense lindy thinking; but I kept feeling that \"liberty, and prosperity\" are just not enough for the kind of big vision Cowen is trying to arrive to. What about justice?\n\nOther\n\nPictures I took at a Palestine protest at MIT.\nI'm in DC most of July (thanks to the sui generis Mehran Jalali for a couch) -- let me know if you're in the area, I'll try to set up a lunch for readers at some point.\nI'm thinking a lot about law these days and pondering spending the fall hanging out at Yale Law School (spending the spring studying physics at MIT was wonderful). If you have anything to do with law (or if you're at Yale), I'd love to talk to you about this.\n\nHave a great July!\nStay frosty,\nAlexey",

I tell them it’s a bad idea and that I use the Erlang compiler infrastructure for it, and they agree to look elsewhere.After launching my notes section, I had to fully clean up my engine. I thought I could write about how it works because it’s fairly unique and interesting, even if you should probably not use it.The RequirementsI first started my blog 14 years ago. It had roughly the same structure as it does at the time of writing this: a list of links and text with nothing else. It did poorly with mobile (which was still sort of new but I should really work to improve these days), but okay with screen readers. It’s gotta be minimal enough to load fast on old devices.There’s absolutely nothing dynamic on here. No JavaScript, no comments, no tracking, and I’m pretty sure I’ve disabled most logging and retention.I write into a void, either transcribing talks or putting down rants I’ve repeated 2-3 times to other people so it becomes faster to just link things in the future. I mostly don’t know what gets read or not, but over time I found this kept the experience better for me than chasing readers or views.Basically, a static site is the best technology for me, but from time to time it’s nice to be able to update the layout, add some features (like syntax highlighting or an RSS feed) so it needs to be better than flat HTML files.Internally it runs with erlydtl, an Erlang implementation of Django Templates, which I really liked a decade and a half ago. It supports template inheritance, which is really neat to minimize files I have to edit. All I have is a bunch of files containing my posts, a few of these templates, and a little bit of Rebar3 config tying them together.There are some features that erlydtl doesn’t support but that I wanted anyway, notably syntax highlighting (without JavaScript), markdown support, and including subsections of HTML files (...",

Not even the small part I’ve carefully selected and loaded into my feed reader.\nNewsblur has an option to expire feed items after some number of days. I’d previously disabled this, erroneously thinking I could at least read the part of the internet I have manually identified as interesting.\nSo, with some hesitation, I turned on expiring items, taking me from several thousand unread items to several hundred. This is a nice, but superficial, step forward. As a result, I’m reading feeds more frequently because there’s a less-scary top-line number. (Even when I had the number hidden, it was still scary.)\nThe good stuff, even if automatically expired, will probably find its way back to me. I’m likely to return to writers I enjoy and look through the archives anyway. Instead of feed FOMO, I should worry more about reading the bigger, guaranteed good things. There are books, essays, longer articles out there. Not to mention making my own stuff. Do more of that!\nI wonder what other kinds of data would be improved with an expiration date. Not that all data should disappear. Backlog/task-shaped data seems the most likely to benefit from automatically deleting themselves. Unread emails, tasks, project work, read-it-later links, watch-list videos, that one season you never got around to watching on a streaming service you’re still paying for. If those archived themselves, or I archived them every few months, maybe that would make for checking off more of the good stuff!",

São 32 milhões de trabalhadores, ou dois terços dos contratos formais.\n     Contratos 6x1: a cara do Brasil que trabalha demais e ganha de menos – Sociedade – CartaCapitalAo menos dois terços dos empregados formais no País estão submetidos a seis dias semanais de trabalho, muitas vezes com salários que não ultrapassam dois mínimos mensais  Lá no finalzinho do texto, faço algumas considerações sobre produtividade, que eu queria expandir aqui.\nUm dos mitos do debate econômico no Brasil é o que culpa os trabalhadores pelo baixo índice de produtividade no país. A baixa escolarização, dizem os economistas liberais, faz com que seja preciso quatro trabalhadores brasileiros para produzir o mesmo que um dos Estados Unidos. \nSó que não é bem assim. Da maneira como o debate é conduzido, ele oculta a forma simples como é calculada a produtividade: o total do PIB dividido pelo total de horas trabalhadas no país. Isso faz com que o cálculo dependa muito mais da estrutura da economia e do mercado de trabalho do país do que das características individuais dos trabalhadores. \nDesde os anos 90, o Brasil passou a importar cada vez mais os produtos consumidos no país - especialmente os de maior valor agregado. Com mais concorrência do exterior, a indústria brasileira encolheu em participação na economia. No mesmo período, o país também focou a economia na exportação de commodities, produtos básicos de baixo valor agregado, e no caso dos produtos agrícolas como a soja a mecanização da lavoura permitiu saltos de produtividade ao trocar trabalhadores por máquinas cada vez mais autônomas. \nCom isso, na prática, o Brasil vende minério de ferro e compra smartphones, para simplificar o raciocínio. Uma tonelada de minério custa US$ 102, ou quase R$ 600. Uma tonelada de minério que o Brasil exporta traz mais ou menos o mesmo preço que o Brasil pa...",
